The Bayesian Optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration [iteration]. [previous_comments]

[new_data_count] new experimental data has been obtained giving us currently a dataset of [data_count] experiments:
[dataset]

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize [target] the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize [target]?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing [target] in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point[constraint_violation] you want the Bayesian Optimizer to try.
