    "rationale": "To maximize solar energy production, the tilt angle should ideally be set to the latitude of the location where the panel is installed, adjusted for seasonal change. A tilt of around 30° is commonly effective for a range of latitudes. The azimuth angle should be set to south (around 180°) to maximize sunlight exposure during the day. A system capacity around 10 kW is considered optimal for home installations, providing a balance between size and efficiency. A DC to AC ratio of about 1.2 is typical, allowing for optimal energy harvesting without significant losses.",
