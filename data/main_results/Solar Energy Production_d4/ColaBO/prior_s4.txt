    "rationale": "Optimal tilt angles for solar panels typically lie between 30° and 45° in most regions to maximize solar gain throughout the year. For azimuth, aligning the panels towards true south (180°) generally captures the most sunlight in the northern hemisphere. A system capacity around 10 kW is often a good balance for residential or commercial installations. A DC to AC ratio of 1.2 is commonly used to optimize performance while ensuring the inverter does not get overloaded.",
