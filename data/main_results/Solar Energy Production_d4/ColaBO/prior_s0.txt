    "rationale":"A tilt angle around 30° is generally considered optimal for solar panels in many locations to maximize exposure to the sun throughout the day. An azimuth angle of 180° (south-facing in the northern hemisphere) aligns well with the sun's path for maximum energy capture. A system capacity of 20 kW is high, allowing for substantial energy production, while a DC/AC ratio of 1.5 helps ensure the inverter operates efficiently and effectively under varying loads.",
