    "rationale":"A tilt angle around 30-40° is often optimal for solar panels in mid-latitude regions, allowing for good energy capture throughout the day. An azimuth angle of 180° (south-facing in the northern hemisphere) is generally best for sunlight exposure. A system capacity of 10 kW and a DC to AC ratio of 1.2 could provide a balance of energy generation without significant losses.",
