    "rationale":"Solar panels generally perform best when they are tilted and oriented towards the sun. A common optimal tilt angle for maximizing daily solar energy production is often set to 30-45 degrees, depending on the latitude. The azimuth angle is optimal when the panels face true south (180Â°) in the northern hemisphere, to capture the most direct sunlight throughout the day. A system capacity towards the higher end of the range allows for better energy production, and a DC to AC ratio of around 1.2 to 1.3 is commonly recommended to optimize energy conversion without significant clipping.",
