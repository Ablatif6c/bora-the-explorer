    "rationale":"To maximize solar energy production, the azimuth angle should face true south in the northern hemisphere (approximately 180°) to capture the most sunlight throughout the day. The tilt angle is generally optimized around the latitude of the location, so an angle of around 30° is often effective for many regions. A higher system capacity can lead to more energy production, thus I suggest the maximum capacity of 20 kW. Lastly, a DC to AC ratio of 1.5 is beneficial for ensuring that the inverter is fully utilized while preventing clipping in high solar irradiance conditions.",
