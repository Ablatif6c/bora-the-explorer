    "rationale": "Research suggests that tilt angles around 20째 to 40째 can provide excellent solar gains, with 35째 being particularly effective in various climates. An azimuth angle of 210째 might optimize exposure during peak sunlight hours for locations further west. A system capacity of 10 kW strikes a balance between size and efficiency, while a dc_ac_ratio of 1.5 ensures maximum energy output and conversion without significant losses. This configuration combines effective angle settings with a robust capacity to capture solar energy.",
