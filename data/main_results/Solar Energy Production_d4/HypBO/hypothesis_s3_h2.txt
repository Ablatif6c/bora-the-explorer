    "rationale": "For regions with consistent sun exposure, a tilt angle of 40° can be beneficial as it helps maximize direct solar gain, particularly in summer months. Retaining an azimuth of 180° ensures maximum sunlight interception throughout the day. A higher system capacity of 18 kW is advantageous for large-scale energy production, and a dc_ac_ratio of 1.4 maximizes the energy output while maintaining system efficiency.",
