    "rationale": "Considering various geographical factors and typical performance metrics, a tilt angle of 40° is generally effective for many regions, especially those at mid-latitudes. Setting the azimuth to 190° allows for slight variations towards the west, which can benefit afternoon production. A system capacity of 18 kW is close to the upper limit and maximizes potential output, while a DC to AC ratio of 1.3 provides a balanced approach to harnessing solar power while accounting for losses.",
