    "rationale": "Considering different geographic locations and their typical solar exposure, I propose a tilt angle of 45° for areas further from the equator, which can potentially capture more sunlight. The azimuth angle remains at 180° (south) for maximum exposure. Setting the system capacity to 10 kW balances energy generation with practical system size. A DC to AC ratio of 1.3 is suggested to improve efficiency under varying loads.",
