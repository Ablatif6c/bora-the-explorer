    "rationale": "To achieve a balance between summer and winter performance, a tilt angle close to 30° is often optimal as it provides a good compromise for seasonal variability. The azimuth remains at 180°, ensuring the panels face true south. A system capacity of 12 kW allows for substantial energy capture without excessive installation costs. A dc_ac_ratio of 1.25 enhances efficiency while avoiding the inefficiencies of oversizing the system.",
