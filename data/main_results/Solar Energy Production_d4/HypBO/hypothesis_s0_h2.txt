    "rationale": "A tilt angle of around 40° is often effective for maximizing energy capture, especially in regions with higher latitudes where the sun's angle changes significantly throughout the year. Setting the azimuth to 190° provides good afternoon sun exposure. A system capacity of 12 kW strikes a balance between energy production needs and equipment efficiency. A DC to AC ratio of 1.1 offers a slight oversizing to capture more energy during optimal solar conditions without excessive inverter clipping.",
