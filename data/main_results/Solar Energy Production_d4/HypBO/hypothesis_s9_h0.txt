    "rationale": "A tilt angle of around 30° is generally considered optimal for solar panels in many regions to capture sunlight effectively. An azimuth angle of 180° (south-facing) is ideal in the northern hemisphere for maximizing exposure. A system capacity of 15 kW is substantial enough to capture significant energy without being excessively large, and a dc_ac_ratio of 1.2 allows for efficient energy conversion while preventing losses. These parameters are chosen based on common best practices for solar energy optimization.",
