    "rationale": "Research suggests that a tilt angle of approximately 40° often yields higher energy output in northern hemisphere climates, as it aligns well with the sun's trajectory. An azimuth angle of 195° can provide additional benefits by slightly adjusting from true south, helping to capture the late afternoon sun. A system capacity of 15 kW enhances potential output without oversizing, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.2 provides a good balance for system efficiency and power yield.",
