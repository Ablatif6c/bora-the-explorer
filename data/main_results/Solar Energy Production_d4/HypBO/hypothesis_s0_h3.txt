    "name": "High-Yield Solar Panel Angle",
    "rationale": "A tilt angle of 35° typically provides a good compromise for maximizing solar energy capture throughout the year in many locations. An azimuth angle of 210° could maximize sun exposure during the brighter afternoon hours, which can be particularly beneficial. A system capacity of 18 kW allows for significant energy production, ideal for larger installations. A DC to AC ratio of 1.4 is advantageous for optimal energy utilization, ensuring the system can support higher outputs during peak sunlight without significant losses.",
