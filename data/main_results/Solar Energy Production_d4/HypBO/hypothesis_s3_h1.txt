    "rationale": "Considering variability in sunlight conditions, especially in areas with seasonal changes, a tilt of around 25° could improve performance year-round, ensuring panels capture more sunlight during different sun paths. The azimuth angle still points to 180° for optimal exposure. A system capacity of 15 kW allows for harnessing significant energy potential, while a dc_ac_ratio of 1.2 can optimize efficiency without oversizing the system.",
