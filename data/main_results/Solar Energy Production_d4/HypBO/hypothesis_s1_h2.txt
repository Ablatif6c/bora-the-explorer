    "rationale": "For maximizing energy production, a tilt angle of around 30° is often preferred in various locations, as it allows for a good average performance year-round. An azimuth angle of 175° helps to capture sunlight in the early morning and late afternoon when it is often most beneficial. Choosing a system capacity of 12 kW strikes a balance between maximizing output and utility requirements, while a DC to AC ratio of 1.4 can help account for inefficiencies due to shading and system losses.",
