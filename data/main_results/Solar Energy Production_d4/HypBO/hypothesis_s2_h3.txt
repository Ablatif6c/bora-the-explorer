    "rationale": "A tilt angle of 40° is beneficial for regions with significant seasonal variation in sunlight, as it can maximize exposure during winter months. The azimuth angle should be set at 200° to capture additional afternoon sunlight, which can increase overall energy production. A system capacity of 16 kW leverages a strong output while ensuring system reliability, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.5 will provide maximum extraction of solar energy, accommodating peak performance outputs without compromising inverter limits.",
