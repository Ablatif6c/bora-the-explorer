    "rationale": "For maximizing energy production, a tilt angle of 40° can be effective for locations with a moderate solar altitude. Keeping the azimuth at 200° can also help capture afternoon sun, which is beneficial in the latter part of the day. A larger system capacity of 18 kW can generate more energy, paired with a DC to AC ratio of 1.4 to maximize efficiency under high production scenarios.",
