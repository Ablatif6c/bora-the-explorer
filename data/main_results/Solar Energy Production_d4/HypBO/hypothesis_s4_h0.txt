    "rationale": "To maximize solar energy production, the tilt angle should be set around 30° to 40°, which is optimal for solar panels in many regions. The azimuth should be set to 180° (south-facing) to capture the most sunlight throughout the day. The system capacity should be large enough to harness significant energy, so I suggest a value around 15 kW. A DC to AC ratio of 1.2 would balance efficiency and performance well.",
