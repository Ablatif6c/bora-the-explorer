    "rationale": "A tilt angle of 30° is generally effective across many regions for maximizing solar input throughout the year, particularly in temperate zones. Maintaining an azimuth of 180° ensures the panel is optimally positioned for sunlight capture. A system capacity of 12 kW is suggested to provide a good balance of energy production without overextending the system. A DC to AC ratio of 1.1 should provide sufficient efficiency while maintaining reliable output.",
