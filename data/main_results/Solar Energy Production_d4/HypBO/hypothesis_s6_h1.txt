    "rationale": "Given that optimal solar energy production can vary with seasonal conditions, a tilt around 45° is often recommended for maximizing winter outputs, particularly in higher latitudes. An azimuth of 200° can help capture afternoon sunlight, accounting for seasonal sun paths. A system capacity of 15 kW is suitable for larger installations where energy demand is higher, and a DC/AC ratio of 1.3 allows for efficient energy production without significant losses.",
