    "rationale": "For maximizing solar energy production, a tilt angle of around 25° tends to be effective for capturing direct sunlight throughout the day, balancing the summer and winter sun angles. Setting the azimuth angle to 190° slightly west of south can account for afternoon sun exposure, potentially increasing energy capture later in the day. A system capacity of 18 kW offers substantial energy generation, while a DC to AC ratio of 1.4 allows for better performance during peak conditions without risking inefficiency.",
