    "rationale": "A tilt angle of 40° can be effective in maximizing energy capture in higher latitudes where the sun's angle is lower during certain times of the year. An azimuth angle of 190° allows the panel to capture sunlight effectively from early morning until late afternoon, enhancing overall production time. A system capacity of 18 kW is closer to the upper limit but can be advantageous in high-energy demand scenarios. A dc_ac_ratio of 1.3 ensures efficiency while facilitating higher energy throughput.",
