    "rationale": "A tilt of 40° is generally effective for solar panels in various regions, as it provides a good compromise between summer and winter sun exposure. Setting the azimuth to 175° will optimize performance by ensuring the panels face slightly southeast, capturing more sunlight during the early part of the day. A system capacity of 8 kW is suitable for situations where space is limited and demand is moderate, while a DC/AC ratio of 1.1 ensures good performance without excessive over-sizing of the inverter.",
