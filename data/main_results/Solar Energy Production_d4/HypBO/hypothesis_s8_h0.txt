    "rationale": "A tilt angle around 30° is generally effective for capturing sunlight throughout the day, striking a balance between morning and afternoon exposure. An azimuth angle of 180° (true south in the northern hemisphere) maximizes exposure to the sun. A system capacity of 15 kW provides a good balance of power generation, while a DC to AC ratio of 1.2 optimizes energy conversion without excessive losses.",
