    "rationale": "Based on general principles of solar energy production, a tilt angle of around 30-40° is often optimal for maximizing solar energy capture in many locations, while the azimuth should ideally face true south (around 180°) in the northern hemisphere to maximize exposure to sunlight throughout the day. A system capacity of 10 kW is a popular choice that balances efficiency and output for residential or moderate commercial settings, and a dc/ac ratio of around 1.2 is commonly used to ensure optimal performance without overloading the inverter.",
