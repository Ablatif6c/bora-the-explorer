    "rationale": "To maximize solar energy production, the tilt angle should be around 30° to 45°, which is generally considered optimal for most latitudes. The azimuth angle can be set to true south (180°) to capture the maximum sunlight throughout the day. A higher system capacity (e.g., 15 kW) can increase the potential output, and a DC to AC ratio of about 1.2 is ideal for standard systems to ensure the inverter operates efficiently without being under or over-utilized.",
