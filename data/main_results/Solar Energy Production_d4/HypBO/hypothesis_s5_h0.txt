    "name": "Optimal Solar Panel Orientation",
    "rationale": "Based on the general principles of solar energy harnessing, a tilt angle of around 30° to 40° is often optimal for latitude considerations, maximizing solar incidence. An azimuth angle of 180° (south) benefits most areas in the Northern Hemisphere where solar energy is predominantly harvested. A system capacity of around 10 kW is a middle ground that balances efficiency and practical deployment. A DC/AC ratio of around 1.2 to 1.3 maximizes power output without significant losses.",
