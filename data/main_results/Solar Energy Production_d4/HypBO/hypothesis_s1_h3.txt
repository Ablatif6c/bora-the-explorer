    "rationale": "A tilt angle of 45° is often effective in maximizing solar energy capture, especially in high-latitude areas where sunlight is more oblique during certain seasons. An azimuth angle of 190° can help utilize solar gain during midday and early afternoon. A system capacity of 18 kW provides substantial energy production potential without exceeding the typical installation thresholds, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.1 is beneficial for ensuring efficiency while accommodating variable production conditions.",
