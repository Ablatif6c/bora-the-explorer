    "rationale": "Research indicates that a 45° tilt can enhance performance during summer months due to higher sun angles, while an azimuth angle of 200° allows for optimal capture of late afternoon sunlight. A system capacity of 18 kW maximizes energy output for larger installations, and a dc_ac_ratio of 1.4 ensures efficiency and minimizes energy losses.",
