    "rationale": "For areas with varying sun exposure, a tilt angle of 30° often strikes a good balance, allowing for effective energy capture throughout different seasons. An azimuth angle of 175° positions the panel slightly east of true south, optimizing morning sunlight. A system capacity of 12 kW is robust enough for good yield without excessive overcapacity, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.1 ensures efficient energy conversion under typical load conditions.",
