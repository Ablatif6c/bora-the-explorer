    "rationale": "To maximize solar energy production, the tilt angle should be around 30° to 40° for general locations, optimizing direct sunlight capture. The azimuth should typically be oriented towards true south (around 180°) in the Northern Hemisphere, maximizing exposure to the sun throughout the day. A higher system capacity (roughly 10 kW) would allow for more energy production without hitting upper limits, and a dc_ac_ratio of 1.3 provides a balance of efficiency without excess losses.",
