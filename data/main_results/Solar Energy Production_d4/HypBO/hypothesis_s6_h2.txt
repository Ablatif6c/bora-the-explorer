    "rationale": "For maximizing energy production, a tilt angle of about 30° can be effective for optimal year-round performance, particularly in temperate climates. An azimuth angle of 190° is effective for capturing sunlight in the afternoon, which can enhance overall energy yield. A system capacity of 12 kW represents a balanced approach for residential applications, while maintaining a DC/AC ratio of 1.4 helps improve performance while minimizing the risk of inverter overload during peak production.",
