    "rationale": "In regions with ample sunlight, a tilt angle of 45° can be beneficial for maximizing energy production, especially during summer months. Setting the azimuth angle to 180° captures maximum sunlight exposure throughout the day by facing directly south. A system capacity of 20 kW leverages the maximum allowed capacity, thus optimizing energy yield, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.4 ensures that the inverter operates efficiently under peak conditions while accommodating some losses.",
