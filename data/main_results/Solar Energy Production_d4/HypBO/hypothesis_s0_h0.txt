    "rationale": "For maximizing solar energy production throughout a day, a tilt angle of around 30° is generally effective as it balances the angle of the sun across different seasons. An azimuth angle of 180° (south-facing in the northern hemisphere) is optimal for direct sun exposure during the day. A system capacity of 10 kW is often a good balance for energy production without being oversized. Lastly, a DC to AC ratio of 1.2 is recommended for ensuring that the system can produce enough energy during sunny days without significant clipping.",
