    "rationale": "A tilt angle of 25° is advantageous for maximizing energy production across different seasons, especially in temperate regions. An azimuth angle of 170° aims slightly east of true south, optimizing morning sun capture. A system capacity of 12 kW is suitable for residential systems, while a dc_ac_ratio of 1.1 helps in optimizing energy conversion without overloading the inverter.",
