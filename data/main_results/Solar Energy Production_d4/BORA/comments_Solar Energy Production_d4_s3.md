# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel over a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. BO is particularly suited for this task due to its ability to model the unknown objective function and make informed decisions about where to sample next, balancing exploration and exploitation. As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance and suggest new points for evaluation, especially when the optimization process plateaus, indicating that the current parameter settings may not yield further improvements.

The intended outcome is to identify the optimal combination of parameters that maximizes energy production, thereby enhancing the efficiency of solar energy systems. By leveraging BO, we aim to efficiently navigate the complex parameter landscape and uncover the conditions that yield the highest energy output.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather insights into the relationship between the parameters and solar energy production. The hypotheses generated consider various angles and system capacities that are expected to yield different energy outputs. A tilt angle of around 30° is often optimal for solar panels in temperate regions, while a higher tilt of 60° can be beneficial in winter months to capture lower sun angles. Conversely, a lower tilt of 15° may be more effective during summer months when the sun is high in the sky. Additionally, exploring azimuth angles of 90° (east) and 270° (west) can help understand the impact of morning and evening sunlight on energy production. Testing the upper limit of system capacity (20 kW) with a moderate tilt and azimuth will also provide insights into the impact of increased capacity on energy production. By sampling these points, we can begin to identify promising areas for further exploration and refine our optimization strategy based on the observed results.

## Iteration 12

As we progress through iteration 11 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest energy output observed so far is 3.10 units, achieved with a tilt of approximately 44.88°, an azimuth of 179.91°, a system capacity of 18.63 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.01. This suggests that a tilt angle around 45° and a south-facing azimuth are promising configurations for maximizing energy production. The data indicates that higher system capacities (above 15 kW) tend to correlate with better energy outputs, although the impact of the DC to AC ratio remains less clear. Conversely, configurations with lower tilt angles (like 15°) and azimuths deviating significantly from south (like 90°) have consistently resulted in lower energy outputs, indicating these subspaces are less effective. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses based on these findings, focusing on the promising regions around 44° to 46° tilt and 179° to 182° azimuth, while discarding less effective configurations. The next steps will involve testing configurations that build on the successful parameters identified, particularly those that maintain a tilt of around 45° and explore higher system capacities.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected at each iteration. Initially, the focus was on exploring a wide range of tilt angles and azimuths, with a particular emphasis on configurations that were traditionally known to yield good energy outputs, such as south-facing orientations and moderate tilt angles. 

As the iterations progressed, we observed that configurations with tilt angles around 50° to 56° and azimuths between 180° and 190° consistently produced higher energy outputs. This led to a refinement of our hypotheses, concentrating on these promising regions while discarding less effective configurations, such as low tilt angles (e.g., 15°) and azimuths significantly deviating from south (e.g., 90°). 

The exploration of higher system capacities (20 kW) also became a focal point, as they correlated positively with energy production. Additionally, the influence of the DC to AC ratio was monitored, although its impact remained less clear throughout the iterations.

In summary, the hypotheses transitioned from a broad exploration to a targeted investigation of specific parameter ranges that demonstrated higher energy outputs, reflecting a more data-driven approach as the optimization progressed.
