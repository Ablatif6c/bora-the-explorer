# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel throughout a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different parameter combinations, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify regions of high energy production and suggest new points for evaluation. 

In the event of a plateau in performance, I will provide insights and hypotheses to explore alternative parameter configurations or consider external factors such as weather conditions or shading effects. The intended outcome is to identify the optimal settings that yield the highest solar energy production, ultimately contributing to more efficient solar energy systems.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising configurations for maximizing solar energy production. The hypotheses generated consider the relationships between tilt and azimuth angles, as well as the system capacity and DC to AC ratio. A high tilt angle (close to 90°) is expected to capture maximum sunlight, particularly in winter months, while a south-facing azimuth (180°) optimizes exposure throughout the day. Conversely, a moderate tilt (around 30°) with an east-facing azimuth (90°) may enhance morning sunlight capture, which is beneficial for energy production. A balanced configuration with a tilt of 45° and azimuth of 180° aims to optimize energy capture throughout the day, providing a good compromise. Additionally, a low tilt angle (10°) with a west-facing azimuth (270°) may enhance energy production in the afternoon. Finally, maximizing system capacity (20 kW) with a tilt of 60° and azimuth of 150° could leverage both high energy output and effective sunlight capture. By strategically selecting points across the parameter bounds, we can effectively sample the space and gather insights into the optimal settings.

## Iteration 14

As we progress through iteration 13, the data reveals several insights into the parameter space for maximizing solar energy production. The highest energy output observed is 3.18 from a configuration with a tilt of 88.27°, azimuth of 175.44°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This suggests that higher tilts combined with optimal azimuth angles can significantly enhance energy capture. The configurations with low tilt angles (like 5.41° and 10°) and extreme azimuth angles (like 358.94° and 0°) have consistently resulted in poor energy production, indicating these regions are detrimental. The subspace around high tilts (around 85° to 90°) and azimuths between 150° and 180° appears to maximize energy effectively. In contrast, configurations with low system capacity (1 kW) and low tilt angles have not performed well. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that underperformed and proposing new configurations that align with the promising regions identified.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses were broad, exploring various configurations across the parameter space, including low and moderate tilt angles with different azimuths. However, as the experiments progressed, it became clear that configurations with high tilt angles (around 85° to 90°) and azimuths between 170° and 180° consistently yielded higher energy outputs.

The highest observed energy outputs prompted a refinement of the hypotheses, focusing on these optimal regions. For instance, hypotheses that included low tilt angles or extreme azimuths were discarded due to their poor performance. Instead, the emphasis shifted towards configurations that maximized both system capacity and effective sunlight capture, particularly those with high tilts and optimal azimuths.

As the iterations continued, confidence levels in the hypotheses were adjusted based on the observed energy outputs. High-confidence hypotheses were consistently aligned with the best-performing configurations, while those that underperformed were downgraded or eliminated.
