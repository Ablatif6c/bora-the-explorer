# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process successfully identified the optimal parameters for maximizing solar energy production, achieving a maximum energy output of 3.37 units. The best-performing configuration included a tilt angle of 70.96°, an azimuth of 181.52°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. Throughout the optimization, hypotheses evolved significantly, with a clear focus on higher tilt angles and maximum system capacities, which aligned with known solar energy behaviors. The findings underscore the importance of precise parameter tuning in enhancing solar energy efficiency.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this optimization process was to maximize the solar energy production of a solar panel over a day by systematically exploring various parameter settings using Bayesian Optimization (BO).

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
Before the optimization began, five initial hypotheses were formulated based on existing knowledge of solar energy dynamics:

1. **Mid-Range Tilt and Azimuth:** A tilt of around 30° and azimuth of 180° was hypothesized to maximize midday solar exposure.
2. **High Tilt for Winter Optimization:** A higher tilt angle of 60° was expected to capture lower sun angles during winter.
3. **Low Tilt for Summer Optimization:** A lower tilt angle of 10° was proposed to reduce shading during summer months.
4. **Optimal Azimuth for East-West Orientation:** An azimuth of 270° was anticipated to capture afternoon sunlight effectively.
5. **Balanced System Capacity:** A balanced system capacity of 8 kW was suggested to optimize energy production without overloading.

These hypotheses were grounded in scientific assumptions about solar radiation patterns and panel efficiency.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on observed performance:

- **Tilt Angles:** The focus shifted from lower tilt angles (10°) to higher angles (70° to 75°), which consistently yielded better energy outputs.
- **Azimuth Angles:** The azimuth was refined to align with successful configurations, particularly around 180° to 190°.
- **System Capacity:** The exploration of higher system capacities (up to 20 kW) was emphasized, as these configurations demonstrated a positive correlation with energy production.
- **DC to AC Ratio:** The ratio was adjusted to explore its impact on efficiency, with a focus on maintaining a balance that maximized output.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was achieved with the following parameters:

- **Tilt:** 70.96°
- **Azimuth:** 181.52°
- **System Capacity:** 20 kW
- **DC to AC Ratio:** 1.00
- **Energy Output:** 3.37 units

Conversely, the worst-performing configuration was characterized by a tilt of 88.63°, an azimuth of 187.90°, a system capacity of 2.13 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.32, yielding an energy output of only 1.94 units. This stark contrast highlights the detrimental effects of extreme tilt angles and low system capacities on energy production.

The optimization outcomes align with known solar energy phenomena, where higher tilt angles enhance exposure to sunlight, particularly during peak hours. The findings also support the theory that maximizing system capacity can lead to improved energy production, as larger systems can harness more solar energy.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Intermediate Tilt Angles:** Future studies could investigate intermediate tilt angles (e.g., 65°) to determine if they yield better performance than the extremes.
2. **Dynamic Azimuth Adjustments:** Implementing a dynamic azimuth adjustment mechanism could optimize energy capture throughout the day, adapting to changing sun positions.
3. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting longitudinal studies to assess seasonal variations in energy production could provide insights into the optimal configurations for different times of the year.
4. **Integration of Weather Data:** Incorporating real-time weather data into the optimization process could enhance the accuracy of predictions and improve energy output.
5. **Testing Alternative DC to AC Ratios:** Further exploration of varying DC to AC ratios beyond the current range may yield insights into efficiency improvements.
