# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel throughout a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the energy output based on the current parameter settings, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify regions of high energy production and suggest new parameter configurations to test. 

In cases where the optimization process plateaus, I will provide insights and hypotheses to explore alternative configurations or refine the search strategy. The intended outcome is to identify the optimal parameter settings that yield the highest solar energy production, ultimately contributing to more efficient solar energy systems.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse configurations that could potentially maximize solar energy production. The hypotheses are designed to cover a range of parameter combinations, considering the relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio. A high tilt angle (around 80°) combined with a southward azimuth (180°) is expected to capture maximum sunlight during peak hours, particularly in regions with high solar insolation. Additionally, a moderate tilt (30°) and an eastward azimuth (90°) may optimize morning sunlight capture, especially in summer months. A balanced configuration with a tilt of 45° and azimuth of 180° aims to optimize energy capture throughout the day. Conversely, a low tilt angle (10°) with a westward azimuth (270°) may be beneficial for capturing late afternoon sunlight, although this configuration may yield lower overall energy production. Finally, maximizing system capacity (20 kW) with a tilt of 70° and azimuth of 150° could enhance overall energy production potential. By strategically selecting points across the parameter space, we can gather valuable data to inform the Bayesian Optimization process and identify promising regions for further exploration.

## Iteration 13

As we progress through iteration 12 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest energy output observed is 3.20 from the configuration with a tilt of 69.36°, azimuth of 173.73°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.13. This suggests that a moderate tilt combined with a southward azimuth can be effective for maximizing energy production. Conversely, configurations with extreme tilt angles (90°) and azimuths (0° or 360°) have resulted in significantly low energy outputs (0.03), indicating that these settings are detrimental. The data suggests that the optimal subspace for maximizing energy lies around moderate tilt angles (around 70°) and azimuths close to 180°, while configurations with low system capacity and extreme angles should be avoided. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly and proposing new configurations that align with the observed successful patterns. The focus will be on configurations that maintain a balance between tilt and azimuth while maximizing system capacity.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses were broad, exploring various configurations across the parameter space, including extreme tilt angles and azimuths. However, as the experiments progressed, it became clear that moderate tilt angles (around 70° to 80°) and azimuths close to 180° consistently yielded higher energy outputs. 

The data revealed that configurations with extreme angles (90° tilt or azimuths of 0° and 360°) resulted in significantly low energy outputs, prompting the exclusion of these settings from future hypotheses. As a result, the focus shifted towards refining the hypotheses to target the optimal subspace identified in the data, emphasizing configurations that balanced tilt and azimuth while maximizing system capacity.

By the final iterations, the hypotheses were more concentrated, with high confidence in configurations that aligned with the successful patterns observed. The emphasis was on maintaining moderate tilt angles and azimuths that effectively captured solar energy throughout the day.
