# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel over a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the energy output based on the current parameter settings, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify promising regions and suggest new parameter combinations to evaluate. 

In the event of a plateau in performance, I will provide insights and hypotheses to explore alternative configurations or refine the search strategy. The intended outcome is to identify the optimal parameter settings that yield the highest energy production, ultimately contributing to more efficient solar energy systems. This experiment will not only enhance our understanding of solar panel performance but also inform future designs and installations.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable data for Bayesian Optimization. The hypotheses generated consider the relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio, focusing on configurations that are likely to enhance solar energy production based on general solar energy principles. The selected points reflect a range of strategies, from optimizing angles for maximum sunlight exposure to balancing capacity ratios for efficiency. Notably, the maximum system capacity is set at 20 kW, and the DC to AC ratio can go up to 1.5, which is crucial for optimizing energy conversion efficiency. The hypotheses also consider the impact of tilt and azimuth angles on energy capture throughout the day, particularly during peak sunlight hours. This diverse set of initial points will provide a robust foundation for the Bayesian Optimization process, allowing for effective exploration of the parameter space.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### Optimal Mid-Tilt

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'tilt': 30, 'azimuth': 180, 'system_capacity': 10, 'dc_ac_ratio': 1.2}

#### High Azimuth Exploration

*Rationale:* Exploring a high azimuth angle (270°) may capture late afternoon sunlight, which can be beneficial for energy production.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'tilt': 20, 'azimuth': 270, 'system_capacity': 15, 'dc_ac_ratio': 1.3}

*Points:*

- {'tilt': 10, 'azimuth': 90, 'system_capacity': 5, 'dc_ac_ratio': 1.1}

## Iteration 14

As we progress through iteration 13 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest energy output observed is 3.37 from a configuration with a tilt of 70.72°, azimuth of 176.37°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1. This suggests that higher tilt angles, particularly around 70°, may be beneficial for energy capture, especially when combined with a suitable azimuth. Conversely, configurations with a tilt of 45° and azimuth of 0° produced no energy, indicating that this subspace is detrimental. The data also shows that lower system capacities (like 1.81 kW) can still yield reasonable energy outputs if paired with optimal angles. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses based on these findings, focusing on higher tilt angles and exploring azimuths that capture afternoon sunlight. We will discard hypotheses that consistently performed poorly, such as the low tilt and high azimuth configurations, and propose new ones that align with the promising regions identified. The promising subspaces include higher tilt angles (around 70°) and azimuths that optimize afternoon sunlight capture. We will continue to explore these regions to maximize energy production.

## Iteration 22

As we continue with the Bayesian Optimization process, the insights gained from previous iterations remain crucial for refining our hypotheses. The data indicates that configurations with higher tilt angles (around 70u00b0) and optimal azimuths (180u00b0) consistently yield high energy outputs. Additionally, exploring higher tilt angles and azimuths that capture afternoon sunlight remains a promising strategy. The previous configurations that performed poorly, particularly those with low tilt angles and azimuths of 0u00b0, have been discarded. The focus now is on testing new configurations that build on the successful parameters identified, particularly those that maintain high tilt angles and favorable azimuths. The next steps will involve evaluating these new hypotheses to maximize energy production effectively.

## Iteration 89

As we reach iteration 88 of the Bayesian Optimization process, the data collected thus far provides significant insights into the performance of various configurations. The highest energy output recorded is 3.38 from a configuration with a tilt of 70.00u00b0, azimuth of 180u00b0, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1. This suggests that configurations with high tilt angles (around 70u00b0) and optimal azimuths (180u00b0) consistently yield the best results. Additionally, configurations with tilt angles between 60u00b0 and 78u00b0 and azimuths between 175u00b0 and 205u00b0 also show promising energy outputs, indicating that afternoon sunlight capture is beneficial. Conversely, configurations with low tilt angles (0u00b0) and azimuths that do not align with optimal sunlight exposure have proven detrimental, yielding minimal energy outputs, such as those with a tilt of 0u00b0 and azimuths of 360u00b0 or 228.64u00b0. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to focus on high tilt angles and favorable azimuths while discarding those that have consistently underperformed. The next hypotheses will explore slight variations around the successful configurations identified, aiming to maximize energy production further.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the Bayesian Optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of tilt and azimuth angles, exploring various configurations to identify promising regions. As the iterations progressed, the data revealed that configurations with higher tilt angles (around 70°) and specific azimuths (particularly 180°) consistently yielded the highest energy outputs, peaking at 3.38.

The insights gained from early experiments led to a refinement of hypotheses, emphasizing high tilt angles and azimuths that optimized afternoon sunlight capture. Configurations that performed poorly, such as those with low tilt angles and non-optimal azimuths, were systematically discarded. This iterative process allowed for a more focused exploration of the parameter space, honing in on configurations that demonstrated the best performance.

By the end of the optimization, the hypotheses were more targeted, reflecting a clear understanding of the relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and energy output. The confidence levels in the hypotheses also evolved, with many achieving high confidence as they aligned closely with the successful configurations identified throughout the iterations.
