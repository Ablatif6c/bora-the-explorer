# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing solar energy production yielded a maximum energy output of 3.38, achieved with a tilt of 70.00°, an azimuth of 180.00°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. The findings indicate that configurations with tilt angles between 70° and 80° and a south-facing azimuth are optimal for energy capture. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data was crucial in identifying these parameters, demonstrating the effectiveness of Bayesian Optimization in exploring complex parameter spaces.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the best parameter settings that maximize solar energy production from a solar panel over a day.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses were designed to explore a diverse range of parameter combinations, including tilt angles, azimuths, system capacities, and DC to AC ratios. The rationale behind these hypotheses included:

1. **Mid-range Tilt and Azimuth:** A tilt of around 30° with a south-facing azimuth was hypothesized to optimize energy capture based on common practices in solar panel installations.
2. **High Tilt for Winter Optimization:** A higher tilt angle of 60° was proposed to capture lower sun angles during winter months.
3. **Low Tilt for Summer Optimization:** A lower tilt angle of 15° was suggested for summer months to maximize energy capture when the sun is high.
4. **East-West Orientation:** Configurations with east-west orientations were hypothesized to capture morning and evening sunlight.
5. **Balanced Capacity and Ratio:** A balanced approach with a system capacity of 5 kW and a DC to AC ratio of 1.5 was proposed to optimize energy conversion efficiency.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization process, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on the observed energy outputs. The focus shifted towards higher tilt angles (70° to 80°) and a south-facing azimuth (180°). The initial hypotheses that explored lower tilt angles and east-facing azimuths were largely discarded due to consistently poor performance.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was achieved with a tilt of 70.00°, an azimuth of 180.00°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00, resulting in an energy output of 3.38. This configuration aligns with known solar energy phenomena, where south-facing panels with optimal tilt angles maximize solar exposure throughout the day.

Conversely, the worst-performing configurations included those with lower tilt angles (15° and 30°) and east-facing azimuths (90°), which consistently yielded energy outputs below 2.00. These findings confirm the detrimental impact of suboptimal tilt and azimuth configurations on energy production.

The optimization outcomes highlight the importance of tilt and azimuth in solar energy capture, reinforcing the need for careful consideration of these parameters in solar panel installations. The data also revealed that configurations with higher system capacities and optimal DC to AC ratios contributed positively to energy production.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Dynamic Tilt Systems:** Investigate the potential of adjustable tilt systems that can change throughout the day to optimize energy capture based on the sun's position.
2. **Incorporation of Weather Data:** Future experiments could integrate real-time weather data to assess how varying conditions (e.g., cloud cover, temperature) impact energy production and optimize parameters accordingly.
3. **Testing Alternative Azimuths:** While south-facing configurations proved optimal, exploring azimuths slightly off south (e.g., 175° to 185°) could yield insights into marginal gains in energy capture.
4. **Long-term Performance Monitoring:** Conduct long-term studies to evaluate the performance of the identified optimal configurations over different seasons and weather conditions.
5. **Investigation of System Capacity Variations:** Explore the impact of varying system capacities beyond the tested range (1 kW to 20 kW) to identify potential benefits of larger or smaller systems.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified the optimal parameters for maximizing solar energy production, with a maximum energy output of 3.38 achieved through a combination of a 70° tilt, 180° azimuth, 20 kW system capacity, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data was crucial in honing in on these optimal configurations. The findings underscore the relevance of tilt and azimuth in solar energy capture and provide a solid foundation for future solar energy experiments and theoretical developments. The insights gained from this study can inform best practices in solar panel installations, ultimately contributing to more efficient and effective solar energy systems.
