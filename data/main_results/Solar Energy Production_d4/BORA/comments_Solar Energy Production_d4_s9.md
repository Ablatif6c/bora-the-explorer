# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel throughout a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the energy output based on current parameter settings, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify regions of high energy production and suggest new parameter configurations to test. 

In the event of a plateau in performance, I will provide insights and hypotheses to guide further exploration, such as adjusting the tilt or azimuth based on solar path predictions or considering the impact of system capacity on energy yield. The intended outcome is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize solar energy production, contributing to more efficient solar energy systems.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising configurations for maximizing solar energy production. The hypotheses generated consider the relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio, leveraging known solar energy principles. The selected points reflect a range of strategies, from optimizing angles for direct sunlight exposure to balancing system capacity and efficiency. Notably, a tilt angle of around 30° is often optimal for midday energy capture, while azimuth angles of 90° and 270° can enhance morning and evening energy production, respectively. The system capacity should be balanced, with moderate values around 8-15 kW being effective for most scenarios, while the DC to AC ratio should be kept between 1.2 and 1.4 for optimal performance. This approach will provide a solid foundation for the Bayesian Optimization process, allowing us to refine our search based on the initial results.
### Initial Hypotheses

## Iteration 13

As we progress through iteration 12 of the Bayesian Optimization, the data reveals several insights into the parameter space for maximizing solar energy production. The highest energy output observed is 3.17, achieved with a tilt of 51.73°, azimuth of 159.57°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This suggests that higher tilt angles, particularly in the range of 50° to 60°, combined with a fixed azimuth around 160°, may be beneficial for energy capture. The data also indicates that lower tilt angles (e.g., 30° and below) and certain azimuth angles (like 90°) have consistently resulted in lower energy outputs, suggesting these configurations are less effective. The subspace of high system capacity (20 kW) and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00 appears to be optimal, while configurations with lower capacities and higher ratios have not performed well. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that underperformed and proposing new configurations that align with the observed successful parameters. The focus will be on exploring higher tilt angles and maintaining a high system capacity to maximize energy production.

### Updated Hypotheses

## Iteration 21

The highest energy output observed is 3.32, achieved with a tilt of 61.34°, azimuth of 167.85°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This indicates that higher tilt angles (above 55°) combined with azimuth angles around 160° are consistently yielding the best results. The subspace of high system capacity (20 kW) and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00 appears to be optimal, as configurations with lower capacities and higher ratios have not performed well. Conversely, configurations with lower tilt angles (e.g., 30° and below) and certain azimuth angles (like 90°) have consistently resulted in lower energy outputs, suggesting these configurations are less effective. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, focusing on higher tilt angles and maintaining a high system capacity to maximize energy production while discarding those that underperformed. The next steps will involve testing configurations that further explore the high tilt and optimal azimuth regions, as well as moderate tilts that may balance energy capture throughout the day.

This reinforces the trend that higher tilt angles (above 60u00b0) combined with azimuth angles around 160u00b0 to 180u00b0 are consistently yielding the best results. The subspace of high system capacity (20 kW) and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00 appears optimal, while configurations with lower tilt angles (e.g., 30u00b0 and below) and certain azimuth angles (like 90u00b0) have consistently resulted in lower energy outputs. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, focusing on higher tilt angles and maintaining a high system capacity to maximize energy production while discarding those that underperformed. The next steps will involve testing configurations that further explore the high tilt and optimal azimuth regions, as well as moderate tilts that may balance energy capture throughout the day. Overall, the data suggests a strong correlation between higher tilt angles and energy output, indicating that further exploration in this region is warranted.

Notably, configurations with very low azimuth angles (close to 0u00b0) and low system capacities have performed poorly, indicating they are detrimental to energy production. Moving forward, I will refine the hypotheses, focusing on higher tilt angles and optimal azimuth regions while discarding those that have underperformed consistently. New hypotheses will explore the upper bounds of tilt and azimuth to maximize energy capture, particularly configurations that push the limits of tilt while maintaining favorable azimuth angles.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the Bayesian Optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broader range of tilt and azimuth angles, with some emphasis on moderate system capacities and DC to AC ratios. However, as the experiments progressed, it became clear that higher tilt angles (above 60°) and specific azimuth angles (around 160° to 180°) consistently yielded the best energy outputs.

The highest observed energy output of 3.38 was achieved with a tilt of 67.78° and an azimuth of 177.19°, reinforcing the trend that configurations with higher tilt angles and optimal azimuths are crucial for maximizing solar energy production. Consequently, the hypotheses were refined to focus on exploring the upper bounds of tilt and azimuth while maintaining a high system capacity of 20 kW and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00.

Lower tilt angles and certain azimuth angles were largely discarded from consideration due to their consistently poor performance. This iterative refinement allowed for a more targeted exploration of the parameter space, leading to increasingly confident hypotheses that aligned with the observed data trends.
