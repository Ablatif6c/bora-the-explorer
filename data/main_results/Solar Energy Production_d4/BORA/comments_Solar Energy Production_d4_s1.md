# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel throughout a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different parameter combinations, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify regions of interest and suggest new points to evaluate based on previous results. 

In the event of a plateau in performance, I will provide insights and hypotheses to guide further exploration, such as adjusting the tilt or azimuth based on solar path predictions or considering the impact of system capacity on energy yield. The intended outcome is to identify optimal parameter settings that maximize energy production, ultimately contributing to more efficient solar energy systems.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising configurations for maximizing solar energy production. The hypotheses generated consider the relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio, leveraging known solar energy principles. Each hypothesis is designed to cover different angles and capacities, ensuring a broad exploration of the parameter space. Notably, the maximum system capacity is set at 20 kW, and the DC to AC ratio can reach up to 1.5, which are critical for optimizing energy output. The proposed configurations include a mix of tilt angles that align with optimal solar capture strategies, such as mid-tilt for temperate regions and low tilt for high solar incidence areas. Additionally, azimuth angles are strategically chosen to capture morning and afternoon sunlight, catering to varying energy demands throughout the day. This comprehensive approach will facilitate the identification of optimal settings that maximize energy production.
### Initial Hypotheses

## Iteration 14

As we progress through iteration 13 of the Bayesian Optimization, the data reveals several insights into the parameter space for maximizing solar energy production. The highest energy outputs were observed with tilt angles ranging from 60° to 90° and a maximum system capacity of 20 kW, indicating that these configurations are favorable for energy capture. The best-performing configurations (iterations 9, 10, 11, and 12) consistently utilized high tilt angles, suggesting that they effectively capture sunlight at different times of the day. Notably, iteration 10 and 11 both achieved an energy output of 3.37, which is the highest recorded so far. Conversely, configurations with lower tilt angles and azimuths that do not align with optimal solar paths (like iterations 2, 3, and 4) yielded lower energy outputs, indicating these subspaces are less effective. Moving forward, I will refine the previous hypotheses based on these findings. The focus will be on high tilt angles and maximizing system capacity while exploring azimuth angles that align with peak sunlight hours. I will discard hypotheses that have consistently underperformed and propose new ones that leverage the insights gained from the current dataset.

## Iteration 26

As we reach iteration 25 of the Bayesian Optimization, the dataset reveals significant insights into the parameter space for maximizing solar energy production. The highest energy outputs were consistently observed with tilt angles between 60° and 90°, particularly with a system capacity of 20 kW. The maximum recorded energy output is 3.37, achieved in iterations 10 and 11, indicating that high tilt angles effectively capture sunlight throughout the day. Azimuth angles of 180° and 270° appear to be favorable, aligning with optimal solar paths for afternoon sunlight. Conversely, configurations with lower tilt angles (below 60°) and azimuths misaligned with peak sunlight hours (like iterations 2, 3, and 4) yielded lower energy outputs, suggesting these subspaces are less effective. Moving forward, I will refine the previous hypotheses, focusing on high tilt angles and maximizing system capacity while exploring azimuth angles that align with peak sunlight hours. I will discard hypotheses that have consistently underperformed, such as those with low tilt angles and ineffective azimuths, and propose new ones that leverage the insights gained from the current dataset.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broader range of tilt angles and azimuth orientations, reflecting a diverse exploration of the parameter space. However, as the iterations progressed, it became evident that high tilt angles (above 60°) and a system capacity of 20 kW consistently yielded the highest energy outputs, particularly with azimuth angles around 180° and 270°.

The data revealed that configurations with lower tilt angles and misaligned azimuths resulted in suboptimal energy production, prompting a shift in focus towards maximizing tilt and capacity. This led to the refinement of hypotheses to emphasize high tilt angles and specific azimuth orientations that aligned with peak sunlight hours. The confidence in hypotheses also evolved, with those consistently yielding higher energy outputs receiving increased confidence ratings, while underperforming configurations were discarded or adjusted.

In summary, the hypotheses transitioned from a broad exploration to a targeted approach, concentrating on high tilt angles and optimal azimuths based on empirical evidence.
