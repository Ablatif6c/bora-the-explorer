# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing solar energy production from a solar panel yielded a maximum energy output of 3.38 units. The most effective configuration involved a tilt of 65.53°, an azimuth of 176.57°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. Throughout the optimization, it became evident that moderate tilt angles (around 70° to 80°) and azimuths close to 180° consistently produced higher energy outputs, while extreme configurations were detrimental. These findings underscore the importance of carefully selecting panel orientations to enhance solar energy capture.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal parameter settings for maximizing solar energy production from a solar panel over a day.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses were broad and aimed to explore various configurations across the parameter space. Key hypotheses included:

1. **High Tilt and Southward Azimuth:** A high tilt angle (around 80°) with a southward azimuth (180°) was expected to maximize energy capture during peak sunlight hours.
2. **Moderate Tilt with Eastward Azimuth:** A moderate tilt (30°) and an eastward azimuth (90°) aimed to optimize morning sunlight capture.
3. **Balanced Configuration:** A balanced approach with a tilt of 45° and azimuth of 180° was hypothesized to optimize energy capture throughout the day.
4. **Low Tilt for Late Afternoon Capture:** A low tilt angle (10°) with a westward azimuth (270°) was expected to capture late afternoon sunlight.
5. **High Capacity with Optimal Tilt:** Maximizing system capacity (20 kW) with a tilt of 70° and azimuth of 150° was anticipated to enhance overall energy production potential.

These hypotheses were based on known solar energy principles, including the impact of tilt and azimuth on solar irradiance capture.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on experimental data. The focus shifted from extreme tilt angles to moderate configurations, particularly around 70° to 80° for tilt and 170° to 180° for azimuth. This shift was driven by the consistent observation that these settings yielded higher energy outputs. The system capacity was maximized at 20 kW, which also contributed to improved performance.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was identified as having a tilt of 65.53°, an azimuth of 176.57°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00, resulting in an energy output of 3.38. This configuration aligns with the known solar energy behavior that suggests southward-facing panels with moderate tilt angles optimize solar irradiance capture throughout the day.

Conversely, the worst-performing configurations included those with extreme tilt angles (90°) and azimuths (0° or 360°), which consistently yielded low energy outputs (0.03). These findings confirm the detrimental effects of extreme orientations on solar energy capture.

The optimization outcomes align with established solar energy principles, emphasizing the importance of panel orientation in maximizing energy production. The data suggests that configurations maintaining a balance between tilt and azimuth while maximizing system capacity are most effective.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Dynamic Tilt Systems:** Investigate the potential of adjustable tilt systems that can change throughout the day to optimize energy capture based on the sun's position.
2. **Incorporation of Weather Data:** Future experiments could integrate real-time weather data to assess how varying conditions (e.g., cloud cover, temperature) impact energy production and adjust parameters accordingly.
3. **Broader Parameter Range:** While the current study focused on specific ranges, exploring a wider range of tilt angles and azimuths could uncover additional optimal configurations.
4. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting long-term studies to assess the performance of identified optimal configurations over different seasons and weather conditions would provide valuable insights into their effectiveness.
5. **Integration of Energy Storage Solutions:** Investigate how energy storage systems can be optimized alongside panel configurations to enhance overall energy efficiency and reliability.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified the optimal parameters for maximizing solar energy production, culminating in a maximum energy output of 3.38. The evolution of hypotheses throughout the experiment highlighted the importance of moderate tilt angles and azimuths in enhancing energy capture. The findings underscore the relevance of carefully selecting panel orientations to improve solar energy systems' efficiency. Future experiments should build on these insights, exploring dynamic systems and broader parameter ranges to further enhance solar energy production and contribute to the development of more efficient renewable energy solutions.
