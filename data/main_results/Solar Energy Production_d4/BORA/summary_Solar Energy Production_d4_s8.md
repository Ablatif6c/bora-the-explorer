# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing solar energy production yielded a maximum energy output of 3.38 units, achieved with a tilt of 66.86°, azimuth of 183.07°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. Throughout the iterations, it became evident that higher tilt angles (75° to 90°) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180°) were generally favorable for energy capture. The findings underscore the importance of refining hypotheses based on experimental data, leading to a more focused exploration of parameter spaces that significantly impact solar energy production.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:** The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal parameter settings for maximizing solar energy production from a solar panel over a day.

**Initial Hypotheses:** The initial hypotheses included a diverse range of parameter settings, focusing on tilt angles, azimuth angles, system capacity, and DC to AC ratios. The rationale behind these hypotheses was based on known solar energy principles, such as the impact of tilt on sunlight exposure and the importance of azimuth for capturing solar radiation throughout the day. The initial hypotheses were:

1. **High Tilt for Winter Optimization:** A higher tilt angle would capture lower sun angles during winter months.
2. **Equatorial Positioning:** A tilt of 0° with a moderate azimuth would optimize energy capture in equatorial regions.
3. **Balanced Capacity and Efficiency:** A moderate system capacity with a higher DC to AC ratio would enhance efficiency.
4. **Maximize Morning Production:** A tilt angle optimized for morning sunlight exposure.
5. **Evening Optimization:** Adjusting azimuth for enhanced energy capture during evening hours.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:** Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on the performance of previous configurations. The focus shifted towards higher tilt angles (75° to 90°) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180°). The exploration of lower tilt angles with moderate capacities was introduced later in the process, revealing unexpected potential for energy capture.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was achieved with a tilt of 66.86°, azimuth of 183.07°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00, resulting in an energy output of 3.38 units. This configuration aligns with the known solar energy phenomenon that higher tilt angles can enhance energy capture during peak sunlight hours, particularly when combined with optimal azimuth settings.

Conversely, the worst-performing configurations were those with extreme azimuth angles (0° and 300°) and lower system capacities, which consistently yielded minimal energy outputs, often approaching zero. This reinforces the importance of selecting appropriate azimuth angles to maximize solar exposure throughout the day.

The optimization outcomes highlight the critical role of parameter interactions in solar energy production. For instance, while higher tilt angles generally improved energy capture, the specific azimuth settings were equally crucial in determining overall performance.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Dynamic Tilt Systems:** Investigating the potential of adjustable tilt systems that can change throughout the day to optimize energy capture based on the sun's position.
2. **Broader Range of Azimuth Angles:** Further exploration of azimuth angles beyond the current range, particularly in regions with varying solar paths, could yield additional insights.
3. **Impact of Environmental Factors:** Incorporating environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and shading effects into the optimization process may provide a more comprehensive understanding of energy production dynamics.
4. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting long-term studies to assess the performance of optimized configurations over different seasons and weather conditions could enhance the robustness of findings.
