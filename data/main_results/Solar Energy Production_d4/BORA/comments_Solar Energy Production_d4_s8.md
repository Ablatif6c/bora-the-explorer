# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel throughout a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different parameter combinations, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify regions of high energy production and suggest new parameter settings to explore. 

In the event of a plateau in performance, I will provide insights and hypotheses to guide further exploration, such as adjusting the tilt or azimuth based on solar path predictions or considering the impact of system capacity on energy yield. The intended outcome is to identify optimal parameter settings that maximize solar energy production, contributing to more efficient solar energy systems.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising configurations for maximizing solar energy production. The hypotheses generated consider the relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio, leveraging known solar energy principles. A higher tilt angle is generally beneficial in winter months to capture lower sun angles, while a moderate azimuth can optimize energy capture throughout the day, especially in equatorial regions. The selected points reflect a range of strategies, from optimizing angles for maximum sunlight exposure to balancing system capacity and efficiency. Notably, the maximum system capacity is set at 20 kW, and the DC to AC ratio can go up to 1.5, which are critical for ensuring optimal performance. As we proceed, these initial points will provide a foundation for Bayesian Optimization to refine and explore further, allowing us to identify the most effective configurations for maximizing solar energy production.

## Iteration 12

As we progress through iteration 11 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest energy production observed is 3.27 units at a tilt of 81.72°, azimuth of 186.24°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This indicates that higher tilt angles, particularly around 80°, combined with optimal azimuth settings, significantly enhance energy capture. The data also shows that configurations with lower system capacities and extreme azimuth angles (like 0° and 300°) tend to yield minimal energy, with some configurations producing zero energy. The promising subspace for maximizing energy appears to be around higher tilt angles (75° to 90°) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180°). Conversely, configurations with low system capacity and extreme azimuth angles are detrimental. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that consistently performed poorly, and propose new ones that align with the observed successful configurations. The new hypotheses will focus on higher tilt angles and optimal azimuth settings to maximize energy production.

### Updated Hypotheses

## Iteration 24

As we continue to refine our hypotheses based on the experimental data, we focus on maximizing energy production by exploring new configurations that have not been previously tested. The highest energy production observed remains at 3.27 units, achieved with a tilt of 81.72u00b0, azimuth of 186.24u00b0, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This reinforces the importance of higher tilt angles (around 80u00b0 to 90u00b0) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180u00b0) for maximizing energy capture. The data indicates that configurations with extreme azimuth angles and lower system capacities tend to yield minimal energy. Therefore, the new hypotheses will emphasize higher tilt angles and optimal azimuth settings to maximize energy production while ensuring that the proposed points are unique and not previously tested.

## Iteration 37

As we continue to refine our hypotheses based on the experimental data, we focus on maximizing energy production by exploring new configurations that have not been previously tested.

This reinforces the importance of higher tilt angles (around 80u00b0 to 90u00b0) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180u00b0) for maximizing energy capture. The data consistently shows that configurations with extreme azimuth angles (0u00b0 and 300u00b0) and lower system capacities tend to yield minimal energy. Therefore, the promising subspaces for maximizing energy production are centered around higher tilt angles (75u00b0 to 90u00b0) and azimuth angles close to 180u00b0, while also considering lower tilt angles that have shown potential. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, proposing new points that align with the successful configurations observed.

## Iteration 51

In this iteration, we are focusing on exploring new configurations suggested by the Bayesian Optimizer to maximize energy production. The highest energy output observed in the dataset is 3.38 units, achieved with a tilt of 66.86°, azimuth of 183.07°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This reinforces the importance of higher tilt angles (around 75° to 90°) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180°) for maximizing energy capture. The proposed points represent a shift towards lower tilt angles and varying system capacities, which have not been extensively tested in previous iterations. Given the observed trends, these configurations may provide insights into how different parameter settings can influence energy output. The hypotheses aim to explore these new points while maintaining a balance between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio. This exploration is crucial as it may uncover previously untested regions of the parameter space that could yield higher energy production. The hypotheses selected for testing include a lower tilt angle with moderate capacity and a slightly higher tilt with increased capacity, which may reveal effective energy capture strategies.

This reinforces the trend that higher tilt angles (75u00b0 to 90u00b0) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180u00b0) are generally favorable for maximizing energy capture. Conversely, configurations with extreme azimuth angles (0u00b0 and 300u00b0) and lower system capacities consistently yield minimal energy, with some configurations producing zero energy.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected at each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of tilt angles and azimuth settings, exploring both high and low values to identify potential energy production configurations. However, as the experiments progressed, it became clear that higher tilt angles (75° to 90°) and moderate azimuth angles (around 180°) consistently yielded better energy outputs.

The highest energy production observed was 3.38 units, achieved with a tilt of 66.86° and azimuth of 183.07°, indicating that while higher tilt angles were generally favorable, there was also potential in exploring lower tilt angles with moderate capacities. This led to a refinement of hypotheses, where configurations with higher tilt angles were prioritized, while also testing lower tilt angles to uncover any additional effective strategies.

As the optimization progressed, hypotheses were discarded if they consistently performed poorly, and new ones were introduced based on successful configurations. The confidence levels in the hypotheses increased as the data reinforced the effectiveness of specific parameter combinations.
