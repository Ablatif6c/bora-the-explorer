# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing solar energy production yielded a peak energy output of 3.38, achieved with a tilt of 67.78°, an azimuth of 177.19°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. Throughout the optimization, it became evident that higher tilt angles, particularly above 60°, combined with specific azimuth angles around 160° to 180°, consistently produced the best results. The findings underscore the importance of precise parameter tuning in solar energy systems to enhance efficiency and output.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal parameter settings for maximizing solar energy production from a solar panel over a day.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses proposed a range of configurations based on known solar energy principles. They included:

1. **Optimal Tilt for Midday Sun:** A tilt angle of approximately 30° was hypothesized to maximize energy capture during midday.
2. **Maximize Morning Energy:** A tilt of 45° with an azimuth of 90° was expected to enhance energy capture in the morning.
3. **Evening Energy Capture:** A tilt of 20° with an azimuth of 270° was proposed for optimizing energy production in the evening.
4. **Balanced System Capacity:** A moderate system capacity of 8 kW with a tilt of 35° and azimuth of 180° was suggested to balance energy capture throughout the day.
5. **High Capacity for Optimal Output:** A configuration with a tilt of 20° and a system capacity of 20 kW was hypothesized to yield high energy output.

These hypotheses were based on the assumption that tilt and azimuth angles significantly influence solar energy capture, particularly in relation to the sun's position throughout the day.

**Hypothesis Evolution:**
- **Confirmed:** The hypotheses regarding higher tilt angles (above 60°) and specific azimuth angles (around 160° to 180°) were confirmed as effective for maximizing energy output.
- **Discarded:** Initial hypotheses involving lower tilt angles (e.g., 30° and below) and certain azimuth angles (like 90°) were discarded due to consistently poor performance.
- **Refined:** Hypotheses were refined to focus on exploring the upper bounds of tilt and azimuth while maintaining high system capacity.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters:
- The focus shifted towards higher tilt angles, particularly between 65° and 90°, as they consistently yielded better results.
- Azimuth angles were concentrated around 160° to 180°, aligning with the sun's trajectory during peak hours.
- The system capacity was maintained at 20 kW, as lower capacities did not perform well.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was achieved with the following parameters:
- **Tilt:** 67.78°
- **Azimuth:** 177.19°
- **System Capacity:** 20 kW
- **DC to AC Ratio:** 1.00
- **Energy Output:** 3.38

Conversely, the worst-performing configurations included:
- **Tilt:** 0.00°
- **Azimuth:** 0.00°
- **System Capacity:** 1.00 kW
- **DC to AC Ratio:** 1.50
- **Energy Output:** 0.03

The results align with known solar energy phenomena, where higher tilt angles facilitate better energy capture during peak sunlight hours. The findings also highlight the importance of azimuth alignment with the sun's path, particularly in the late afternoon and early evening.

Unexpectedly, configurations with very low azimuth angles (close to 0°) and low system capacities performed poorly, indicating that these settings are detrimental to energy production. The data suggests a strong correlation between higher tilt angles and energy output, reinforcing the need for precise parameter tuning in solar energy systems.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments are proposed:
1. **Exploration of Dynamic Tilt Systems:** Investigate the potential benefits of adjustable tilt systems that can change throughout the day to optimize energy capture continuously.
2. **Broader Azimuth Range:** Test a wider range of azimuth angles, particularly those that may capture energy during different seasons or geographical locations.
3. **Impact of Weather Conditions:** Conduct experiments that account for varying weather conditions, such as cloud cover and temperature, to assess their impact on energy production.
4. **Integration of Energy Storage Systems:** Explore the effects of integrating energy storage solutions with varying system capacities and configurations to enhance overall energy efficiency.
5. **Advanced Modeling Techniques:** Utilize machine learning and advanced modeling techniques to predict optimal configurations based on historical weather and solar data.

The optimization process successfully identified the optimal parameters for maximizing solar energy production, culminating in a peak energy output of 3.38. The evolution of hypotheses throughout the experiment highlighted the importance of higher tilt angles and specific azimuth alignments in enhancing energy capture.
