# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process successfully identified the optimal parameters for maximizing solar energy production, achieving a maximum energy output of 3.38 units. The best configuration involved a tilt angle of 80°, an azimuth of 180°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. Throughout the optimization, hypotheses evolved from broad explorations of parameter space to focused investigations of specific configurations that consistently yielded higher energy outputs. This study underscores the importance of systematic parameter tuning in enhancing solar energy efficiency.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this optimization process was to maximize the solar energy production of a solar panel over a day by systematically exploring various parameter settings using Bayesian Optimization (BO).

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses were based on established knowledge of solar energy systems. They included:

1. **Mid-Range Tilt and Azimuth:** A tilt of around 30° and a south-facing azimuth (180°) were hypothesized to maximize solar exposure based on traditional solar panel installations.
2. **High Tilt for Winter Optimization:** A higher tilt angle of 60° was proposed to capture lower sun angles during winter months.
3. **Low Tilt for Summer Optimization:** A lower tilt angle of 15° was suggested for summer months when the sun is high in the sky.
4. **East-West Orientation:** Exploring azimuth angles of 90° (east) and 270° (west) to evaluate the impact of morning and evening sunlight.
5. **Max Capacity Exploration:** Testing the upper limit of system capacity (20 kW) with moderate tilt and azimuth to assess the impact of increased capacity on energy production.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on observed performance:

- **Tilt Angle:** Initially explored a wide range of tilt angles, but the focus shifted to higher angles (70° to 80°) as they consistently yielded better results.
- **Azimuth Angle:** The azimuth was refined to focus on south-facing orientations, as deviations led to lower energy outputs.
- **System Capacity:** Higher capacities (20 kW) were prioritized, as they correlated positively with energy production.
- **DC to AC Ratio:** The impact of this ratio was monitored, but its influence remained less clear throughout the iterations.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was achieved with a tilt of 80°, an azimuth of 180°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00, resulting in an energy output of 3.38 units. This configuration aligns with known solar energy principles, where south-facing panels with higher tilt angles capture more sunlight, particularly during peak solar hours.

Conversely, the worst-performing configurations included low tilt angles (e.g., 15°) and east-west orientations, which consistently resulted in lower energy outputs, highlighting the inefficiency of these setups in maximizing solar exposure.

The optimization outcomes reinforced the understanding that higher tilt angles can significantly enhance energy production, particularly in regions with high solar insolation. The findings also suggest that while system capacity plays a crucial role, the tilt and azimuth angles are paramount in determining overall efficiency.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments include:

1. **Exploration of Variable Tilt Angles:** Investigate the potential benefits of adjustable tilt systems that can change throughout the day or season to optimize energy capture.
2. **DC to AC Ratio Analysis:** Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the DC to AC ratio's impact on energy production, as its influence was less clear during this study.
3. **Geographical Variability:** Test configurations in different geographical locations to assess how local solar conditions affect optimal parameter settings.
4. **Integration of Weather Data:** Incorporate real-time weather data into the optimization process to dynamically adjust parameters based on changing conditions.
5. **Long-Term Performance Monitoring:** Implement long-term monitoring of the best-performing configurations to assess their performance over time and under varying environmental conditions.
