# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel throughout a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different parameter combinations, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify promising regions and suggest new points for evaluation. When the optimization process plateaus, I will provide insights and hypotheses to explore alternative configurations or refine existing ones, ensuring that we continue to seek conditions that maximize energy production.

The intended outcome is to identify the optimal settings for the solar panel that yield the highest energy output, contributing valuable insights for solar energy applications and enhancing overall system performance.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse configurations that could potentially maximize solar energy production. The hypotheses generated consider various relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio, reflecting different strategies for optimizing energy output. A tilt angle of around 30° is often optimal for solar panels in temperate regions, while a south-facing azimuth (180°) maximizes exposure to sunlight throughout the day. Higher tilt angles (e.g., 60°) can be beneficial in winter months to capture lower sun angles, while lower tilt angles (e.g., 15°) can be effective in summer to maximize energy capture when the sun is high. Additionally, setting the azimuth to 90° (east) and 270° (west) with a moderate tilt can help capture morning and evening sunlight, potentially increasing total daily energy production. A balanced approach with a system capacity of 5 kW and a DC to AC ratio of 1.5 can optimize energy conversion efficiency while maintaining system performance. By sampling these points, we can gather valuable data to inform the Bayesian Optimization process and identify promising regions in the parameter space.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### Mid-range Tilt and Azimuth

*Rationale:* A tilt of around 30° is often optimal for solar panels in temperate regions, while an azimuth of 180° (south-facing) maximizes exposure to sunlight throughout the day.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'tilt': 30, 'azimuth': 180, 'system_capacity': 10, 'dc_ac_ratio': 1.2}

#### High Tilt for Winter Optimization

*Rationale:* A higher tilt angle of 60° can be beneficial in winter months to capture lower sun angles, combined with a south-facing azimuth.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'tilt': 60, 'azimuth': 180, 'system_capacity': 15, 'dc_ac_ratio': 1.3}

#### Low Tilt for Summer Optimization

*Rationale:* A lower tilt angle of 15° can be effective in summer to maximize energy capture when the sun is high in the sky, with an azimuth of 180°.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'tilt': 15, 'azimuth': 180, 'system_capacity': 12, 'dc_ac_ratio': 1.1}

## Iteration 11

As we reach iteration 10 of the Bayesian Optimization process, we can analyze the experimental data to draw insights about the parameter space. The highest energy output observed is 3.35, achieved with a tilt of 72.47°, azimuth of 173.55°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This suggests that higher tilt angles, particularly around 70° to 80°, combined with a south-southwest azimuth, are promising regions for maximizing energy production. The data indicates that configurations with lower system capacities (5 kW) and higher DC to AC ratios (1.5) have not performed well, as seen in previous iterations. The subspaces that maximize energy appear to be characterized by higher tilt angles (above 70°) and azimuths close to 180°, while configurations with lower tilt angles (15° and 30°) and east-facing azimuths (90°) have consistently resulted in lower energy outputs. In light of these findings, I propose to refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly and introducing new configurations that align with the observed trends. The focus will be on higher tilt angles and optimal azimuths to further explore the promising regions of the parameter space.

### Updated Hypotheses

## Iteration 19

As we continue to analyze the data from the Bayesian Optimization process, the insights remain consistent with previous findings.

This reinforces the notion that configurations with a tilt around 70u00b0 to 80u00b0 and a south-facing azimuth (180u00b0) are optimal for maximizing energy production. The data continues to show that lower tilt angles and east-facing azimuths have not performed well, confirming their detrimental impact on energy output. The focus remains on exploring higher tilt angles and optimal azimuths to further refine our search for maximum energy production. The next hypotheses will target these promising regions while introducing new configurations to avoid redundancy and enhance exploration.

This reinforces the trend that configurations with a tilt around 70u00b0 to 80u00b0 and a south-facing azimuth (180u00b0) are optimal for maximizing energy production. The data also indicates that lower tilt angles (15u00b0 and 30u00b0) and east-facing azimuths (90u00b0) consistently yield lower energy outputs, confirming their detrimental impact. The subspaces that maximize energy are characterized by higher tilt angles (around 70u00b0 to 80u00b0) and azimuths close to 180u00b0, while configurations with lower tilt angles and east-west orientations have not performed well. Moving forward, I will refine the hypotheses to focus on these promising regions, discarding those that have underperformed and introducing new configurations that align with the observed trends. The next hypotheses will target these optimal configurations to further explore the parameter space and maximize energy production.

The highest energy output observed is 3.38, achieved with a tilt of 70.00u00b0, azimuth of 180.00u00b0, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1.00. This reinforces the trend that configurations with a tilt between 70u00b0 and 80u00b0 and a south-facing azimuth (180u00b0) are consistently yielding the best results. Notably, configurations with lower tilt angles (15u00b0 and 30u00b0) and east-facing azimuths (90u00b0) have consistently resulted in lower energy outputs, confirming their detrimental impact on energy production. The subspaces that maximize energy are characterized by higher tilt angles (around 70u00b0 to 80u00b0) and azimuths close to 180u00b0, while configurations with lower tilt angles and east-west orientations have not performed well. Moving forward, I will refine the hypotheses to focus on these promising regions, discarding those that have underperformed and introducing new configurations that align with the observed trends.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the Bayesian Optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected at each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses were diverse, exploring a range of tilt angles, azimuths, system capacities, and DC to AC ratios. However, as the experiments progressed, it became clear that configurations with tilt angles between 70° and 80° and a south-facing azimuth (around 180°) consistently yielded the highest energy outputs, peaking at 3.38.

The data indicated that lower tilt angles (15° and 30°) and east-facing azimuths (90°) were detrimental to energy production, leading to the refinement of hypotheses. As a result, hypotheses focusing on higher tilt angles and optimal azimuths were prioritized, while those that underperformed were discarded. The confidence levels in the hypotheses also shifted, with high confidence in configurations that aligned with the observed trends and lower confidence in those that did not.

In summary, the hypotheses became increasingly focused on the most promising regions of the parameter space, emphasizing the importance of tilt and azimuth in maximizing solar energy production.
