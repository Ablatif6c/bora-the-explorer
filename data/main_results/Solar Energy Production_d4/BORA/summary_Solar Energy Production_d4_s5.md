# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing solar energy production from a solar panel yielded a maximum energy output of 3.38 kWh. The most effective configuration involved a tilt angle of 70°, an azimuth of 180°, a system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1. These findings underscore the importance of high tilt angles and optimal azimuths in enhancing solar energy capture, particularly during peak sunlight hours. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data was crucial in identifying these optimal parameters.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the best parameter settings that maximize solar energy production from a solar panel over a day.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses were based on general principles of solar energy capture and included the following:

1. **Optimal Mid-Tilt:** A tilt angle around 30° was hypothesized to balance sunlight exposure throughout the day.
2. **High Azimuth Exploration:** A high azimuth angle (270°) was expected to capture late afternoon sunlight.
3. **Low Tilt for High Latitude:** A lower tilt angle (10°) was proposed for higher latitudes to maximize energy capture during summer months.
4. **Balanced Capacity Ratio:** A DC to AC ratio of 1.5 was anticipated to optimize energy conversion efficiency.
5. **Morning Sun Focus:** A tilt of 40° and azimuth of 60° was hypothesized to optimize energy capture during morning hours.

These hypotheses were grounded in existing solar energy theories, which suggest that tilt and azimuth angles significantly influence energy output.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization process, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on the performance of previous configurations. The focus shifted towards higher tilt angles (around 70°) and azimuths that optimized afternoon sunlight capture. The initial hypotheses were discarded as they did not align with the observed data, leading to a more targeted exploration of the parameter space.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was identified as follows:

- **Tilt:** 70.00°
- **Azimuth:** 180.00°
- **System Capacity:** 20 kW
- **DC to AC Ratio:** 1.00
- **Energy Output:** 3.38 kWh

Conversely, the worst-performing configuration was:

- **Tilt:** 0.00°
- **Azimuth:** 360.00°
- **System Capacity:** 20 kW
- **DC to AC Ratio:** 1.00
- **Energy Output:** 0.03 kWh

The results align with known solar energy phenomena, where higher tilt angles enhance energy capture by optimizing the angle of incidence of sunlight. The consistent performance of configurations around 70° tilt and 180° azimuth supports the theory that maximizing exposure to direct sunlight during peak hours is critical for energy production. Unexpectedly, configurations with low tilt angles and non-optimal azimuths yielded minimal energy outputs, reinforcing the importance of proper panel orientation.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Dynamic Tilt Systems:** Investigating the potential of adjustable tilt systems that can change throughout the day to optimize energy capture dynamically.
2. **Incorporation of Weather Data:** Integrating real-time weather data into the optimization process could enhance predictions of energy output based on varying sunlight conditions.
3. **Testing Additional Azimuth Angles:** Further exploration of azimuth angles beyond the current range may uncover additional configurations that maximize energy capture.
4. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting long-term studies to assess the performance of identified optimal configurations across different seasons and weather conditions.
5. **Investigation of Shading Effects:** Analyzing the impact of shading from nearby structures or vegetation on energy output could provide insights for optimal panel placement.
