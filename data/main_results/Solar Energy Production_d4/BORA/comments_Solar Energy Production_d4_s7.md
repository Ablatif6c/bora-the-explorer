# Solar Energy Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize solar energy production from a solar panel throughout a day by optimizing key parameters using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The parameters under investigation include tilt angle (0° to 90°), azimuth angle (0° to 360°), system capacity (1 kW to 20 kW), and the DC to AC capacity ratio (1 to 1.5). These parameters are crucial as they directly influence the panel's efficiency and energy output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore the defined parameter space. This approach utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the performance of different parameter combinations, allowing for efficient sampling of the space. As the optimization progresses, BO will identify regions of high energy production and suggest new parameter settings to explore. 

In the event of a plateau in performance, I will provide targeted suggestions for parameter adjustments based on the current model's predictions, helping to refine the search for optimal conditions. The intended outcome is to identify the best combination of parameters that maximizes solar energy production, ultimately contributing to more efficient solar energy systems.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising configurations for maximizing solar energy production. The hypotheses generated consider the relationships between tilt, azimuth, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio, reflecting expected behaviors based on solar energy principles. A tilt angle around 30° is often effective for maximizing solar gain throughout the day, particularly in temperate climates. Low tilt angles (10°) combined with high system capacities (up to 20 kW) can capture more sunlight during peak hours, especially in regions with high solar insolation. Additionally, east-facing setups (90° azimuth) with higher tilts (45°) can be beneficial for capturing morning sunlight, while west-facing configurations (270° azimuth) with higher tilts (60°) may optimize energy capture in the afternoon. A balanced approach with a tilt of 25° and azimuth of 180° can provide a good compromise for energy capture throughout the day. By sampling various combinations, we can effectively cover the parameter space and gather insights into optimal settings, ultimately leading to improved solar energy production.

## Iteration 16

As we progress through iteration 15 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest energy output observed is 3.38, achieved with a tilt of 66.93°, azimuth of 180.92°, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1. This suggests that higher tilt angles, particularly around 60° to 70°, combined with maximum system capacity, are favorable for energy production. The data also indicates that configurations with lower system capacities (1 kW) and certain azimuth angles (e.g., 90°) tend to yield lower energy outputs, highlighting detrimental subspaces. The azimuth angle of 180° appears to be consistently beneficial, as seen in several high-performing configurations. Additionally, configurations with a tilt of 50° and above have shown promising results, particularly when paired with high system capacities. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses based on these findings, focusing on higher tilt angles and maximizing system capacity while exploring azimuth angles around 180° and 270° for potential improvements.

The highest energy output remains at 3.38, achieved with a tilt of 66.93u00b0, azimuth of 180.92u00b0, system capacity of 20 kW, and a DC to AC ratio of 1. This reinforces the importance of high tilt angles and maximum system capacity.

The subspaces maximizing energy are characterized by high tilt angles and high system capacities, particularly around 180u00b0 azimuth. Conversely, configurations with low tilt angles and low system capacities are detrimental, as seen in several low-performing setups. Moving forward, I will refine our hypotheses, focusing on high tilt angles and maximum system capacity while exploring azimuth angles around 180u00b0 and 270u00b0 for potential improvements. Additionally, I will consider testing higher tilt angles beyond 75u00b0 to further investigate their impact on energy capture.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of parameter settings, including various tilt angles, azimuth orientations, system capacities, and DC to AC ratios. As the experiments progressed, it became clear that higher tilt angles (around 66° to 85°) and maximum system capacity (20 kW) consistently yielded the highest energy outputs, with the peak observed at 3.38 energy units.

The data revealed that configurations with azimuth angles around 180° were particularly beneficial, while extreme azimuth angles and low system capacities resulted in poor performance. Consequently, the hypotheses were refined to emphasize high tilt angles and maximum capacity, while exploring azimuth angles primarily around 180° and 270°.

As the optimization advanced, the confidence in the hypotheses increased, particularly for those configurations that aligned with the observed trends. The final hypotheses were more focused and targeted, reflecting a deeper understanding of the parameter relationships and their impact on energy production.
