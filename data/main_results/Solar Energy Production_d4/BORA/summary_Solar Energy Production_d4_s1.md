# BORA for Energy Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing solar energy production yielded a maximum energy output of 3.37, achieved through configurations featuring high tilt angles (between 63° and 90°) and a system capacity of 20 kW. The most effective azimuth angles were found to be around 180° and 270°, aligning with peak sunlight hours. The findings underscore the importance of high tilt angles in capturing solar energy effectively, while also highlighting the need for targeted exploration of parameter spaces to achieve optimal configurations.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the best parameter settings for maximizing solar energy production from a solar panel over a day. This involved systematically exploring the parameter space defined by tilt angle, azimuth angle, system capacity, and DC to AC ratio.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses were based on established principles of solar energy capture. They included:

1. **Optimal Mid-Tilt Configuration:** A tilt angle around 30-40° was hypothesized to balance direct sunlight capture and seasonal variations.
2. **High Capacity with Low Tilt:** A low tilt angle (around 10°) was expected to maximize energy capture in regions with high solar incidence.
3. **East-Facing Configuration:** An azimuth angle of 90° was proposed to effectively capture morning sunlight.
4. **West-Facing High Capacity:** A west-facing panel (azimuth 270°) was anticipated to capture afternoon sunlight, beneficial for evening energy demands.
5. **Balanced Configuration:** A moderate tilt and azimuth were expected to provide consistent energy production throughout the day.

These hypotheses were grounded in the understanding of solar path dynamics and energy capture efficiency.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on empirical data. The focus shifted towards high tilt angles (above 60°) and a system capacity of 20 kW, as these configurations consistently yielded the highest energy outputs. Azimuth angles were refined to target those that aligned with peak sunlight hours, particularly around 180° and 270°.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing configuration was achieved with the following parameters:

- **Tilt:** 63.81°
- **Azimuth:** 173.32°
- **System Capacity:** 20 kW
- **DC to AC Ratio:** 1.00
- **Energy Output:** 3.37

Conversely, the worst-performing configurations were characterized by low tilt angles and misaligned azimuths, such as:

- **Tilt:** 10.00°
- **Azimuth:** 200.00°
- **System Capacity:** 15 kW
- **DC to AC Ratio:** 1.30
- **Energy Output:** 1.69

The results align with known solar energy phenomena, where higher tilt angles enhance the panel's ability to capture sunlight throughout the day, particularly during peak hours. The consistent performance of configurations with high tilt angles supports the theory that maximizing the angle of incidence can significantly improve energy capture.

Unexpected findings included the relatively low performance of configurations with azimuth angles misaligned with optimal solar paths, reinforcing the importance of precise orientation in solar energy systems.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Future experiments should explore the following avenues:

1. **Dynamic Tilt Adjustments:** Investigate the potential benefits of adjustable tilt mechanisms that can optimize angles throughout the day based on solar path predictions.
2. **Geographical Variability:** Conduct experiments in different geographical locations to assess how local solar conditions affect optimal parameter settings.
3. **Integration of Weather Data:** Incorporate real-time weather data to refine azimuth and tilt adjustments dynamically, potentially improving energy capture during variable conditions.
4. **Exploration of DC to AC Ratios:** Further investigate the impact of varying DC to AC ratios on energy output, particularly in configurations with high system capacities.

Additionally, enhancing the Bayesian Optimization process with more sophisticated models could yield better results by allowing for more nuanced exploration of the parameter space.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified high tilt angles and maximum system capacity as critical factors for maximizing solar energy production, achieving a peak output of 3.37. The evolution of hypotheses throughout the experiment demonstrated the importance of data-driven adjustments, leading to a focused exploration of effective parameter combinations. The findings are relevant for future solar energy experiments, emphasizing the need for targeted parameter optimization and the potential for further advancements in solar energy capture technologies.
