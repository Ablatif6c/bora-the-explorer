Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 11.
3 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.
You generated the following comments in the previous iterations and your suggestion points were subsequently evaluated and appended to the dataset:
## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "As we reach iteration 5, we have gathered valuable insights from our experimental dataset. Notably, hypothesis 3, which focused on mid-range values, yielded the highest target value of 4.518, followed closely by hypothesis 4 with a symmetrical distribution that produced a target of 4.220. These results indicate that a balanced mixture of negative and positive values in the mid-range is beneficial for maximizing the target function. The hypothesis exploring extreme values (hypothesis 1 and 2) consistently performed poorly, with targets of only 2.312 and 1.995, respectively, highlighting that extreme parameter values are not ideal for optimization. Additionally, the fifth hypothesis, with diverse sampling, resulted in a moderate target value of 3.331, showing some potential but not as strong as the top performers. In summary, the most promising subspaces involve mid-range values that balance positive and negative inputs. It is clear that further exploration around these mid-range configurations can lead to increased target values. Given these findings, we will discard hypotheses that focus solely on extreme parameter values and instead refine our hypotheses to further investigate the regions yielding higher outputs. New hypotheses will emphasize combinations that build on successful patterns observed in the mid-range and symmetrical distributions.",

## Iteration 9:
{
    "comment": "In iteration 8, insights gained from our experimental dataset reveal significant trends in the behavior of the target function. The highest observed target value thus far is 5.808 from hypothesis 8, which focuses on balanced mid-range values emphasizing positivity while maintaining a mixture of negative inputs. Hypotheses focusing on mid-range and symmetrical distributions have consistently yielded high outputs, indicating that configurations avoiding extreme parameter values are optimal. The configurations yielding the best results cluster around mid-range inputs with a preference for values close to positive midpoints, especially in the ranges around 12 and 10. In contrast, the hypotheses targeting extreme parameter values have been detrimental, producing consistently poor performance with maximum outputs of only 2.312 and 1.995, reinforcing their removal from future exploration. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses, focusing on slight variations around the successful points from this iteration while discarding those emphasizing extremes. The next hypotheses will prioritize further exploration within the promising parameter neighborhoods identified in prior evaluations, with an intent to discover even higher maxima.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
