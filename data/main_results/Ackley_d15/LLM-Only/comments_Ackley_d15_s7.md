## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to optimize a mathematical black-box function by identifying the set of parameters that maximizes the target objective. This will be accomplished through systematic exploration of a defined parameter space comprising 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\). Each variable has a range of plausible values constrained between -30 and 20, allowing for a total of 41 possible discrete settings for each parameter. 

The optimization process will be guided by sequential evaluations of the target function as new parameter combinations are tested. Since the function is a black box, its internal workings are unknown, which requires a strategy that balances exploration (trying a wide range of values) and exploitation (refining the search around promising candidate solutions). 

As we progress, we will collect and analyze data from each evaluation to build an increasingly informed statistical model of the function's behavior relative to the parameters. The ultimate intention is to identify the parameter settings that yield the highest function output, thereby maximizing the target objective efficiently within the specified constraints. This experiment will not only enhance our understanding of the function's landscape but also culminate in actionable insights for practical applications reliant on these optimizations.

## Initial Thoughts

As we initiate the optimization process, we have developed a diverse range of hypotheses to investigate the behavior of the black-box function across the defined parameter space. Our hypotheses strategically encompass various regions, including extreme positive and negative values, central mid-range settings, and symmetrical arrangements that may reveal underlying interactions. By probing both the boundaries and the center of the parameter space, we aim to gather insights into the function's response to different input configurations. The expectation is that these initial points will help identify not only local optima but also guide subsequent evaluations within promising regions. Analyzing the outputs from these exploratory points will refine our understanding of parameter relationships and allow us to adapt our optimization strategy effectively.

## Iteration 6

After thoroughly analyzing the data from the first five iterations, we can draw some important conclusions regarding the behavior of the black-box function in relation to the parameter space. The highest target score achieved is 9.303 from the mid-range stability experiment (iteration 3), indicating that a more balanced approach yields better outcomes within the center region of the parameter space. The boundary variation hypothesis (iteration 2) produced a lower result of 2.060, demonstrating that extreme combinations are less effective for optimization. Similarly, the negative exploration hypothesis (iteration 4) scored 2.339, reinforcing the idea that lower parameter values do not contribute favorably to maximizing the target. The symmetrical approach (iteration 5) yielded 5.852, which, while higher than some of the others, still falls short of the mid-range findings. Given these insights, we will focus our future strategies on refining mid-range hypotheses to explore subtle variations that could yield improved targets while discarding hypotheses that consistently underperform, such as those focusing on boundary extremes. The encouraging findings from the mid-range values suggest promising subspaces that warrant further exploration. The next steps will involve generating new hypotheses centered around these peak outputs to drive the optimization process more effectively.

## Iteration 9

As we continue the optimization journey through iteration 8, our analysis of the dataset reveals essential insights regarding the function's behavior relative to various parameter configurations. The highest target score achieved thus far is 9.303 from the mid-range stability hypothesis (iteration 3), signifying that configurations around balanced mid-range values clearly offer optimal outcomes. The subsequent optimized mid-range configurations from iterations 6 and 7 yielded target scores of 6.824 and 7.832, respectively, further supporting the notion that mid-range parameters are preferable. Other experiments, particularly those testing extreme values (2.060) and negative ranges (3.314), have consistently underperformed, underscoring their lack of effectiveness. Moving ahead, our primary focus will be on refining the mid-range explorations to delineate possible variations that can push the output even higher. We will discard the underperforming hypotheses related to extreme values and negative ranges, instead honing in on promising mid-range combinations that may reveal untapped potential in the parameter landscape. The goal is to leverage our findings to refine our approach effectively and maximize the target objective moving forward.

## Iteration 13

As we conclude iteration 12, it is evident that our exploration within the mid-range parameter configurations has yielded the most favorable results regarding the black-box function's target output. The highest target score recorded is 9.303 from iteration 3, associated with the mid-range stability hypothesis, underscoring that balanced configurations around the central values are optimal. Subsequent mid-range configurations from iterations 6 and 7 scored 6.824 and 7.832, respectively, indicating that the mid-range area (approximately (x_0 = 5-8), (x_1 = 5-6.5), (x_2 = 6-7.5)) continues to be promising. On the other hand, experiments involving extreme values from iteration 2 produced a low score of 2.060, while negative ranges like those tested in iteration 4 resulted in targets as low as 2.339, confirming these regions are significantly detrimental to maximizing the target. Given the insights gained from iterations 1 to 12, it is clear our focus should be centered on refining mid-range hypotheses while diminishing efforts on underperforming extreme or negative configurations. Moving forward, we will investigate slight adjustments in previously successful mid-range values to potentially discover further enhancements in targeting optimal outputs.

## Iteration 16

As we conclude iteration 15, our analyses of the optimization journey reveal that the highest target score achieved is 9.303 from iteration 3, characterized by balanced mid-range values across the parameters. The most promising subspace for maximizing the target continues to lie around mid-range configurations, particularly in the vicinity of (x_0 in [5, 8]), (x_1 in [5, 6.5]), and (x_2 in [6, 7.5]), with similar patterns for the other parameters. The recent evaluation from iteration 15, which yielded a score of 7.706 from a less extreme exploration, indicates potential for moderate parameter values within low ranges, although they still fall short compared to the most effective mid-range strategies.Furthermore, iterations involving extreme positive values (demonstrated in iterations 1 and 2) and negative extremes (notably from iteration 4) consistently yielded the lowest results, reinforcing their ineffectiveness for maximizing the target objective. Given these insights, we will focus on refining hypotheses based on successful mid-range configurations while carefully considering potential improvements from non-extreme low ranges. Next steps involve exploring slight variations around the previously successful mid-range settings to uncover hidden opportunities for maximizing the output.

## Iteration 19

As we conclude iteration 18, an analysis of the collected data clarifies promising trends of the black-box function's responses to various parameter configurations. The peak target score observed is 10.440 from iteration 18, where adjustments were made within a controlled lower range. This indicates that while mid-range values have historically been effective (with a significant score of 9.303 from iteration 3), the recent exploration suggests potential exists in moderated negative ranges without resorting to extremes. Across the dataset, configurations around mid-range values — particularly where (x_0) is approximately between 5 and 8, (x_1) between 5 and 6.5, and similar patterns for other variables — consistently yield favorable outcomes. Conversely, extreme configurations and significant negative ranges have proven consistently less effective, with scores below 3.5 observed from those trials. Given this context, future exploration should focus primarily on refining viable mid-range combinations alongside slightly adjusted configurations in lower ranges that could yield improved results. We will be discarding hypotheses centered around extreme values that lack productivity while continuing to explore nuanced variations for our best-performing mid-range values.

## Iteration 22

As we conclude iteration 21, the data accumulated throughout the optimization journey reveals several critical insights about the black-box function's response to various parameter configurations. The highest target score recorded to date is 13.413, achieved in iteration 21, indicating substantial potential within the controlled low-range configurations we recently explored. These results highlight a significant shift from earlier findings that emphasized mid-range values, which previously peaked at 9.303 in iteration 3. The promising subspaces for maximizing the target now appear to lie primarily within moderate low-range values, specifically around (x_0 in [-5, -3]), (x_1 in [-4, -2]), and (x_2 in [-2, 0]).     Conversely, extreme configurations, particularly those tested in iterations 1 and 2, have consistently performed poorly, yielding scores lower than 3.5 and demonstrating the ineffectiveness of both extreme positive and negative parameter values for maximizing the target objective. Moving forward, the optimization strategy will focus on refining hypotheses from these newly identified productive low-range subspaces while also maintaining slight adjustments in previously successful mid-range configurations. We aim to capture any dependencies among parameters that may maximize output effectively while discarding underperforming hypotheses centered around extremes. With these insights, we are set to explore the nuanced variations within these promising parameter regions to further enhance the target output.

## Iteration 25

As we conclude iteration 24, the insights gathered from our experiments reveal critical trends regarding the optimization of the black-box function. The highest target score recorded is 15.262 from iteration 24, achieved through configurations concentrated in controlled low-range values. This demonstrates a significant shift from earlier strategies that prioritized mid-range parameters, which peaked at 9.303 in iteration 3. Notably, the most promising parameter subspaces are found around (x_0 in [-5, 0]), (x_1 in [-4, -1]), and (x_2 in [-2, 1]), showcasing their interaction potential for maximizing the target output. In contrast, configurations at extreme values, whether positive or negative, have consistently shown poor performance, with scores well below 4. Moving forward, our strategy will revolve around refining hypotheses that exploit these successful low-range and moderate combinations while discarding those related to underperforming extremes. The next steps will involve generating new points specifically adjusted from the highest-performing configurations to improve the chances of maximizing the target objective further.

## Iteration 28

As we conclude iteration 27, our analysis reveals critical insights into the optimization progress regarding the black-box function. The highest target score recorded so far is 15.973, obtained during the recent explorations of controlled low-range configurations. This underscores a significant shift in our strategy; previously, configurations within mid-range values reached a peak performance of 9.303. The data show that the most effective parameter subspaces for maximizing the target lie primarily within moderate low ranges, specifically around (x_0 in [-5, 0]), (x_1 in [-4, -1]), and (x_2 in [-2, 1]). Conversely, experiments involving extreme values, both positive and negative, have consistently yielded poor performance across various iterations, often averaging below a score of 4. Moving forward, our strategy will focus intensively on refining hypotheses based on these successful low-range configurations. Additionally, we will incorporate slight deviations in mid-range values that have previously demonstrated some potential. By adopting a more collaborative approach to explore adjacent values within the high-performing regions, we aim to push the boundaries of the target outputs even higher while discarding ineffective extreme configurations.

## Iteration 55

As we continue our exploration of the black-box function, the insights derived from previous iterations emphasize the effectiveness of controlled low-range configurations in maximizing the target output. The peak target score of 17.008 highlights the potential found in configurations centered around (x_0 in [-5, 0]), (x_1 in [-4, -1]), and (x_2 in [-2, 1]). In contrast, utilizing extreme values has consistently led to poor performance outcomes. Our focus in the next iterations will be on refining and exploring slight adjustments within these productive low-range configurations while also considering potential enhancements in previous mid-range setups. This strategic orientation aims to further push the boundaries of the target output while minimizing the influence of underperforming extremes in our hypotheses.

## Iteration 58

As we conclude iteration 57, a thorough analysis of our optimization journey reveals several critical insights regarding the black-box function's parameter interactions. The highest target score recorded to date is 17.008, achieved through carefully calibrated low-range configurations, particularly within the intervals of (x_0 in [-5, 0]), (x_1 in [-4, -1]), and (x_2 in [-2, 1]). These configurations have consistently exhibited superior effectiveness in maximizing the target output, indicating a decisive shift in our strategy from previously favored mid-range configurations, which peaked at 9.303. In stark contrast, configurations employing extreme positive and negative values have consistently yielded disappointing results, often scoring below 4, underscoring their ineffectiveness for our optimization objectives. Given this context, our focus moving forward will remain on refining and exploring slight adjustments within these successful low-range configurations, while considering minor variations in promising mid-range setups that have demonstrated some potential. Also, hypotheses centered on extreme values will be discarded as they have not contributed positively to our optimization goals. The next hypotheses will aim to leverage the insights gained throughout this optimization journey, seeking to further push the boundaries of the target output through meticulous fine-tuning within high-performing parameter subspaces.

## Iteration 85

As we proceed with our optimization process, the emphasis remains on refining configurations around the successful low-range values that have shown promise in maximizing the target output. The best recorded score persists at 17.008, stemming from configurations centered in the ranges of (x_0 in [-5, 0]), (x_1 in [-4, -1]), and (x_2 in [-2, 1]). Our strategy is to explore unique points within these low-range setups while concurrently investigating slight modifications in previously effective mid-range configurations.

## Iteration 88

As we conclude iteration 87, we have gained valuable insights into the optimization of the black-box function. The highest target score recorded to date is 17.008, achieved through configurations primarily focused on controlled low-range values, specifically in the parameter ranges of (x_0 in [-5, 0]), (x_1 in [-4, -1]), and (x_2 in [-2, 1]). These results establish that careful selection within these intervals yields optimal outcomes, reinforcing our strategy to emphasize low-range configurations in our future experiments. On the contrary, configurations utilizing extreme values—both positive and negative—have consistently returned suboptimal results, with many scoring below 4. This poor performance affirms the ineffectiveness of such parameters in maximizing the target objective. To capitalize on our findings, we will continue refining successful low-range configurations while integrating slight modifications to previously promising mid-range setups that may uncover further beneficial interactions. Additionally, hypotheses focusing on extreme values will be discarded as they have proven consistently unproductive. Our upcoming hypotheses will reflect these insights, aiming to enhance the exploration of productive parameter subspaces to push the boundaries of target outputs further.

Our strategy is to delve deeper into these successful configurations while also exploring unique parameter combinations that might further enhance our results.

## Iteration 94

As we conclude iteration 93, our analysis of the optimization process reveals substantial insights regarding the performance of the black-box function with respect to parameter configurations. The highest target score recorded to date is **17.008**, achieved during iterations centered on controlled low-range values particularly within the intervals of (x_0 in [-5, 0]), (x_1 in [-4, -1]), and (x_2 in [-2, 1]). This indicates that maintaining our focus in these ranges continues to yield optimal outcomes. Conversely, configurations employing extreme values, both positive and negative, consistently delivered subpar results, often scoring below 4, reinforcing their ineffectiveness in achieving our optimization objectives. Therefore, as we move forward, our strategy will emphasize refining these successful low-range configurations while incorporating novel point combinations that might capture further potentialities for enhancement. Minor adjustments to previously effective mid-range setups will also be assessed to uncover possible synergies among the parameters. Discarding hypotheses related to extreme configurations will streamline our approach so we can effectively push the boundaries of target outputs in future iterations.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved considerably based on the experimental results obtained from each iteration. In the initial phases, the focus was on exploring bounds and extreme values to identify potential optimal configurations. However, the data showed a clear preference for mid-range values, culminating in a notable score of 9.303 from iteration 3.

As further iterations progressed, particularly from iteration 18 onwards, the research pivoted toward controlled low-range configurations, which consistently gained higher target scores, notably culminating at 17.008. This shift prompted a strategic emphasis on exploiting low-range parameter spaces (approximately within ranges of \(x_0\) from [-5, 0], \(x_1\) from [-4, -1], and \(x_2\) from [-2, 1]) while continuing to examine subtle modifications in mid-range configurations. The focus on extreme values gradually diminished as their performance in subsequent iterations consistently fell below satisfactory target outputs.

In summary, the hypotheses transitioned from an exploratory and broad approach toward a more refined focus, leveraging proven successful areas while discarding unproductive configurations. The evolution in confidence across the hypotheses reflects this narrowing down of focus and the pursuit of optimal configurations.
