## Experiment Overview

The aim of this experiment is to optimize a mathematical black-box function by identifying the parameter settings that maximize the target objective. The optimization process will explore a multi-dimensional input space defined by 15 parameters (x_0 to x_14), each having bounds ranging from -30 to 20. This broad search space allows for a diverse examination of the effects of various input combinations on the output of the target function.

Each parameter represents an independent variable that could influence the function's behavior. The optimization process will be conducted under the constraints that all parameters must remain within their specified bounds to ensure valid experimental conditions. The objective is to efficiently navigate this space to uncover the optimal settings that yield the highest possible output from the black-box function.

As observations are collected through evaluations at various parameter combinations, the data will be utilized to refine the search, leading to better hypotheses and enhancing the overall understanding of the function's landscape. Ultimately, the intended outcome is to determine the most effective parameter configuration, thereby maximizing the performance of the black-box function within the defined constraints.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling phase of our optimization experiment, we have explored a diverse set of hypotheses to capture the behavior of the black-box function across various regions of the parameter space. The selected hypotheses range from central values to extreme bounds, reflecting an intent to investigate both stable and potentially high-performance configurations. We hypothesize that the function may exhibit significant interactions among the parameters, both in the middle of the bounds and near the edges. The chosen points include opportunities to probe midrange combinations, positive extremes, and mixed values that could yield insights into how the function behaves under different conditions. This diversity is expected to not only unveil the potential maxima but also to help identify interactions between variables that influence target performance. As we analyze the results from these initial points, our understanding of the parameter landscape will be refined, guiding future optimization efforts. Overall, our objective is to leverage this foundational dataset to uncover the optimal parameter settings that maximize the target output effectively.

## Iteration 6

In this initial sampling phase of our optimization experiment, we explored a diverse set of hypotheses to capture the behavior of the black-box function across various regions of the parameter space. The hypotheses examined ranged from central values to extreme boundaries, with trials targeting both stable and potentially high-performance configurations. Our initial points revealed significant interactions between parameters, notably around extreme values and central tendencies. We hypothesize that the function's performance may peak in ranges where parameters are balanced with mixed values, rather than purely focusing on extrema, as indicated by initial evaluations. Consequently, we observed that while certain combinations of extreme inputs produced high outcomes, they often lacked stability across multiple trials. The data suggests an area of potential maxima near the mid-range values where parameters are positively correlated. This insight emphasizes the importance of refining our hypotheses based on collected observations, particularly in exploring less extreme configurations that led to promising outputs. Overall, leveraging this preliminary dataset, we will strategically investigate these balanced configurations to maximize the target output effectively.

## Iteration 8

As we continue advancing in our optimization process, valuable insights into the behavior of the black-box function have been unearthed. The evaluations across multiple iterations have shown that configurations leveraging mid-range and balanced parameter values yield the highest target outputs. Notably, the best observed outcome so far is 5.331 from the Balanced Centre Configuration in iteration 6, indicating that a composite influence of parameters centered around less extreme values tends to enhance performance. Conversely, configurations featuring extreme input values have resulted in diminished outcomes, particularly those configurations involving multiple negative values or pushing parameter values towards their limits, as evidenced in iterations 2 and 3. The detrimental subspaces appear to reside in the use of extreme values, which may lead to disruptive interactions among parameters. Moving forward, we will refocus our hypotheses on balanced configurations, drawing from the successful aspects of previous evaluations, particularly around the mid-range values. Our next assessments will involve exploring variations of these successful configurations while strategically introducing diversity to potential parameter interactions for optimal target maximization.

## Iteration 64

As we proceed to iteration 65 of our optimization journey, we continue to refine our understanding of the black-box function's behavior.

Conversely, configurations leaning towards extreme values or featuring multiple negative parameters persistently yield suboptimal results and must be avoided. Our focus moving forward will be to maintain exploration within upper mid-range settings while discarding poorly performing setups. The hypotheses will prioritize combinations that demonstrate robust positive influences while remaining balanced among selected parameters.

## Iteration 100

Upon comprehensive analysis of the data collected through 99 iterations, the highest recorded target output stands at 6.939. This was achieved through configurations that emphasize balanced upper mid-range parameter values, specifically clustered around those between 5 and 12. These successful configurations consistently foster strong positive interactions among the input parameters, leading to optimal performance outcomes. In contrast, combinations that lean towards extreme values, especially those featuring multiple negative inputs or pushing limits on the parameter bounds, have consistently resulted in poor outputs, often falling below 3.0. Moving forward, our strategy will focus on refining these effective upper mid-range setups to enhance positive interactions while systematically discarding configurations that have demonstrated suboptimal performance. The hypotheses will target combinations within the identified effective subspaces, ensuring a careful balance among parameters to maximize our target output.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization journey, our hypotheses evolved significantly as we gathered data from each experimental iteration. In the initial hypotheses, we focused on sampling diverse regions of the parameter space, including extreme values and central configurations. However, as we analyzed the outputs, it became evident that configurations leveraging balanced mid-range values around 5 to 12 yielded the highest results, with the peak observed output reaching 6.939. 

Experiments consistently demonstrated that combinations with multiple negative values or extreme positive values led to lower outputs, reinforcing the need to refine our search strategy. Hence, our subsequent hypotheses aimed at optimizing upper mid-range configurations with strong positive interactions while discarding poorly performing setups. We began to concentrate on fine-tuning specific configurations that had previously shown promise, leading to a more focused exploration of effective subspaces that fostered synergistic interactions among parameters. 

The evolution included shifting from a broad exploratory approach to a more refined, hypothesis-driven strategy centered on balanced setups that maximize target outputs more effectively.

Below is a summary table of how confidence in the hypotheses evolved:

| Iteration | Confidence | Comments                                             |
|-----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Medium     | Initial diverse sampling across boundaries            |
| 6         | High       | Mid-range insights highlight higher outputs          |
| 11        | High       | Refinement towards balanced configurations            |
| 24        | High       | Peak output achieved; strong focus on mid-range      |
| 70        | High       | Validated focus on upper mid-range configurations    |
| 100       | High       | Final refinements targeting synergistic interactions  |

In conclusion, our hypotheses experienced a transition from diverse exploration to a focused refinement approach, significantly guided by observed performance outcomes.
