## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "As we reach iteration 5, we have gathered valuable insights from our experimental dataset. Notably, hypothesis 3, which focused on mid-range values, yielded the highest target value of 4.518, followed closely by hypothesis 4 with a symmetrical distribution that produced a target of 4.220. These results indicate that a balanced mixture of negative and positive values in the mid-range is beneficial for maximizing the target function. The hypothesis exploring extreme values (hypothesis 1 and 2) consistently performed poorly, with targets of only 2.312 and 1.995, respectively, highlighting that extreme parameter values are not ideal for optimization. Additionally, the fifth hypothesis, with diverse sampling, resulted in a moderate target value of 3.331, showing some potential but not as strong as the top performers. In summary, the most promising subspaces involve mid-range values that balance positive and negative inputs. It is clear that further exploration around these mid-range configurations can lead to increased target values. Given these findings, we will discard hypotheses that focus solely on extreme parameter values and instead refine our hypotheses to further investigate the regions yielding higher outputs. New hypotheses will emphasize combinations that build on successful patterns observed in the mid-range and symmetrical distributions.",

## Iteration 9:

The highest observed target value thus far is 5.808 from hypothesis 8, which focuses on balanced mid-range values emphasizing positivity while maintaining a mixture of negative inputs. Hypotheses focusing on mid-range and symmetrical distributions have consistently yielded high outputs, indicating that configurations avoiding extreme parameter values are optimal. The configurations yielding the best results cluster around mid-range inputs with a preference for values close to positive midpoints, especially in the ranges around 12 and 10. In contrast, the hypotheses targeting extreme parameter values have been detrimental, producing consistently poor performance with maximum outputs of only 2.312 and 1.995, reinforcing their removal from future exploration. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses, focusing on slight variations around the successful points from this iteration while discarding those emphasizing extremes.

## Iteration 18:
{
    "comment": "As we reach iteration 17, our dataset now offers a comprehensive view of the target function's response to various parameter configurations. The highest target value observed thus far is 6.140, achieved through a configuration that emphasizes mid-range values combined with a favorable distribution of positive and negative inputs. This reinforces our earlier conclusions about the effectiveness of mid-range parameters, particularly the ranges between -5 to 15. Notably, configurations yielding outputs above 5.8 typically blend positive and neutral values effectively, indicating they are the most promising areas for further exploration. Conversely, parameter settings reliant on extreme values, such as those approaching -30 and 20, consistently resulted in low outcomes (2.312 and 1.995 respectively), warranting their exclusion from future tests. Looking ahead, we should focus on slight variations around successful points identified in previous iterations and increase the emphasis on positive values while maintaining a balanced mix of negatives. The next hypotheses will primarily target regions anchored in the mid-range configurations, particularly those that have previously shown robust output values. Our strategy should refine our understanding of these interactions to maximize the target further.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
