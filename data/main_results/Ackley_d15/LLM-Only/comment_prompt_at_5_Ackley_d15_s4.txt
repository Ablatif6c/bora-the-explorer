Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 5.
5 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.


Currently the dataset contains 5 experiments:
 iteration  x_0  x_1  x_2  x_3  x_4  x_5  x_6  x_7  x_8  x_9  x_10  x_11  x_12  x_13  x_14  target

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
