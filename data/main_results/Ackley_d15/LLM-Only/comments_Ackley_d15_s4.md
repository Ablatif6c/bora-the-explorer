## Experiment Overview

In this experiment, we aim to optimize a mathematical black-box function by systematically exploring a multivariate parameter space defined by 15 input variables, designated as x_0 through x_14. Each parameter has the same bounds, which range from -30 to 20, thus creating a continuous search space within these limits. The primary goal is to identify the optimal settings of these input variables that maximize the output of the target function.

The 15 parameters allow for a comprehensive exploration of the relationships and interactions among them, which is critical in optimizing black-box functions, where the underlying mathematical form is unknown. Although there are no explicit constraints beyond the defined bounds for each parameter, the nature of their interactions may impose implicit constraints that should be considered in our optimization strategy. 

The intended outcome of this experiment is to collect a dataset of function evaluations corresponding to various input configurations, from which we can derive the optimal parameter combination that yields the highest objective value. By analyzing the resulting data, we can refine our understanding of the parameter sensitivities and guide further experimentation to improve the optimization process iteratively.

## Initial Thoughts

As we commence this optimization journey, our initial hypotheses aim to explore key regions of the parameter space effectively, balancing between high, low, and mid-range values to uncover the target function's behavior. Evaluating points near the upper and lower bounds will help identify potential peaks and troughs in the function's output. Additionally, configurations that emphasize mid-range values allow for an examination of parameter interactions that may not be apparent at the extremes. The inclusion of diverse combinations—such as symmetrical distributions and balanced mixtures—can showcase the function's nonlinear characteristics and how parameters interact. Collectively, these hypotheses provide a strategic coverage of the parameter landscape, which will facilitate the identification of promising areas for further refinement and optimization.

## Iteration 6

As we reach iteration 5, we have gathered valuable insights from our experimental dataset. Notably, hypothesis 3, which focused on mid-range values, yielded the highest target value of 4.518, followed closely by hypothesis 4 with a symmetrical distribution that produced a target of 4.220. These results indicate that a balanced mixture of negative and positive values in the mid-range is beneficial for maximizing the target function. The hypothesis exploring extreme values (hypothesis 1 and 2) consistently performed poorly, with targets of only 2.312 and 1.995, respectively, highlighting that extreme parameter values are not ideal for optimization. Additionally, the fifth hypothesis, with diverse sampling, resulted in a moderate target value of 3.331, showing some potential but not as strong as the top performers. In summary, the most promising subspaces involve mid-range values that balance positive and negative inputs. It is clear that further exploration around these mid-range configurations can lead to increased target values. Given these findings, we will discard hypotheses that focus solely on extreme parameter values and instead refine our hypotheses to further investigate the regions yielding higher outputs. New hypotheses will emphasize combinations that build on successful patterns observed in the mid-range and symmetrical distributions.

## Iteration 9

In iteration 8, insights gained from our experimental dataset reveal significant trends in the behavior of the target function. The highest observed target value thus far is 5.808 from hypothesis 8, which focuses on balanced mid-range values emphasizing positivity while maintaining a mixture of negative inputs. Hypotheses focusing on mid-range and symmetrical distributions have consistently yielded high outputs, indicating that configurations avoiding extreme parameter values are optimal. The configurations yielding the best results cluster around mid-range inputs with a preference for values close to positive midpoints, especially in the ranges around 12 and 10. In contrast, the hypotheses targeting extreme parameter values have been detrimental, producing consistently poor performance with maximum outputs of only 2.312 and 1.995, reinforcing their removal from future exploration. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses, focusing on slight variations around the successful points from this iteration while discarding those emphasizing extremes. The next hypotheses will prioritize further exploration within the promising parameter neighborhoods identified in prior evaluations, with an intent to discover even higher maxima.

## Iteration 12

As we conclude iteration 11, we have amassed a substantial dataset that provides critical insights into our parameter configurations. The highest target value observed to date is 5.865, from the most recent hypothesis, which utilized a combination of mid-range values with a slight positive bias. This affirms our previous conclusions that configurations around -5 to 15 generally yield optimal results, particularly when maintaining a favorable distribution of positive values. Successful subspaces identified from the data cluster around mid-range inputs, especially near 10 to 15 for positive parameters and around 0 for negative ones. Conversely, hypotheses that explored extreme values such as those near -30 and 20 consistently resulted in low target outputs, emphasizing their exclusion from future probing. Going forward, we plan to refine our exploration by emphasizing the promising mid-range neighborhoods. We will test hypotheses focusing on configurations that have yielded the best results while introducing slight adjustments to enhance performance further. By concentrating our efforts on these fruitful areas, we aim to converge closer to the optimal parameter settings and maximize the target function.

## Iteration 15

As we conclude iteration 14, our accumulated experimental data offer critical insights into the behavior of the target function. The highest target value observed thus far is 5.872, achieved through a configuration emphasizing mid-range values with a favorable blend of positive and neutral inputs. This finding reinforces our earlier conclusions that configurations centered around mid-range parameters, specifically those in the range of -5 to 15 for optimal performance, are most effective for maximizing the target function. Notably, the results indicate that slight positive biases in the inputs significantly enhance outputs, as configurations transitioning from neutral to positively biased setups have consistently yielded better results. Conversely, configurations involving extreme parameter values, particularly near -30 and 20, have performed poorly, reaffirming the decision to exclude these regions from further testing. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses based on successful patterns identified in previous iterations. Specifically, we will optimize towards combinations that embrace the promising mid-range identified while maintaining a mixture of positive and negative values. Our focus will be on slight variations around these successful points to discover even higher maxima and deepen our understanding of the interactions among parameters.

## Iteration 18

As we reach iteration 17, our dataset now offers a comprehensive view of the target function's response to various parameter configurations.

This reinforces our earlier conclusions about the effectiveness of mid-range parameters, particularly the ranges between -5 to 15. Notably, configurations yielding outputs above 5.8 typically blend positive and neutral values effectively, indicating they are the most promising areas for further exploration. Conversely, parameter settings reliant on extreme values, such as those approaching -30 and 20, consistently resulted in low outcomes (2.312 and 1.995 respectively), warranting their exclusion from future tests. Looking ahead, we should focus on slight variations around successful points identified in previous iterations and increase the emphasis on positive values while maintaining a balanced mix of negatives. The next hypotheses will primarily target regions anchored in the mid-range configurations, particularly those that have previously shown robust output values. Our strategy should refine our understanding of these interactions to maximize the target further.

As we proceed through iteration 21, our accumulated dataset reveals crucial insights regarding the optimization of the target function. The highest target value recorded so far is 6.317, achieved with a configuration that emphasizes mid-range values while balancing positive and negative inputs. This reaffirms the effectiveness of configurations primarily within the range of -5 to 15, which consistently yields superior results. Notably, sets of inputs clustering around -4 to -3 for negatives and 13 to 15 for positives demonstrate particularly successful outcomes. The presence of positive biases within the mid-range has proven advantageous, with many of our best configurations showing a tendency toward higher positive values. Conversely, results from configurations at the extreme values of -30 and 20 have repeatedly underperformed, justifying their exclusion from future hypotheses. Moving forward, it is essential to focus on refining our best-performing configurations through slight variations in the mid-range while ensuring a stable mixture of positive and negative parameters.

As we proceed with our optimization efforts, the dataset continues to highlight the effectiveness of mid-range parameter configurations, particularly in the context of balancing positive inputs with some negative ones. The previously identified optimal regions ranging between -5 and 15 for the parameters remain pivotal. Given our most recent discoveries, we will implement variations that build upon successful patterns while avoiding configurations that have not shown favorable performance in previous iterations.

## Iteration 28

As we conclude iteration 27, our dataset provides detailed insights into the optimization landscape of the target function. The highest target value observed is 6.622, achieved with a configuration emphasizing mid-range values combined with a balance of positive and negative inputs. This confirms our previous findings that parameters primarily within the range of -5 to 15 are optimal for achieving higher outputs. Specifically, successful configurations frequently cluster around negative input values of -4 to -3 and positive values of 14 to 15, effectively yielding consistently higher outcomes. The emphasis on strong positive bias has been advantageous, as configurations leaning positively tend to enhance performance, while extremes close to -30 and 20 have underperformed severely. Given these findings, we can conclude that the next steps involve refining our best-performing configurations, focusing primarily on those identified subspaces while exploring slight variations to further probe for optimal configurations. Our upcoming hypotheses will prioritize mid-range explorations, particularly those that maintain balanced positive with negative values, to uncover even greater maxima for the target function. Overall, our emphasis will be on configurations that successfully blend high positive values with mid-range dynamics to maximize outputs in future iterations.

## Iteration 32

As we analyze the accumulated experimental dataset, it is evident that the most successful configurations predominantly exist within the mid-range values, specifically between -5 and 15. The highest observed target value is 6.622, achieved with a configuration that effectively blends positive and negative inputs while emphasizing a positive bias. Our analysis indicates that successful subspaces cluster around negative input values ranging from -4 to -2 and positive values between 14 and 15. Moreover, configurations with positive values above 10 tend to yield higher outputs, as evidenced by their consistent performance in previous iterations. Conversely, configurations leaning towards extreme values, particularly those near -30 and 20, have performed poorly, with outputs below 3.000, confirming their exclusion from our future explorations. Hence, our next hypotheses will enhance the exploration of mid-range configurations while incorporating diverse combinations that maintain a positive bias to uncover potential maximum outputs. This focused and disciplined strategy will allow us to optimize further and increase our chances of discovering optimal parameter settings for the target function.

## Iteration 35

As we conclude iteration 34, our comprehensive dataset reveals critical insights regarding the target function's behavior in response to various parameter configurations. The highest observed target value is 6.622, achieved with a configuration that emphasizes mid-range values and incorporates a balanced mix of positive and negative inputs, particularly clustering negative inputs between -4 and -2, and positive inputs between 14 and 15. These findings confirm earlier hypotheses that emphasize mid-range parameters, especially those yielding high outputs with slight positive biases. We have consistently observed that configurations leaning towards extreme values, such as those around -30 and 20, perform poorly, producing outputs under 3.000. Moving forward, our strategy will focus on refining configurations around observed high-performing regions, introducing minor variations while maintaining a blend of positive and negative influences, in order to explore even greater peaks in the target output. This disciplined and targeted approach will enhance our optimization efforts as we aim to maximize the target function further.

## Iteration 39

As we reach iteration 38, our dataset reveals valuable insights into the optimization landscape of the target function. The highest observed target value is 6.622, achieved through configurations that effectively blend strong positive values with a mix of mid-range parameters. Successful subspaces cluster around negative inputs between -4 and -2 and positive values between 14 and 15, confirming that maintaining a strong positive bias significantly enhances performance. Conversely, extreme parameter settings, especially those near -30 and 20, yield poor performance, consistently resulting in outputs under 3.000, which underscores the necessity to exclude these configurations from future explorations. Moving forward, our approach will focus on refining hypotheses to explore promising mid-range configurations while ensuring a balanced mix of positive and negative values. We will discard hypotheses tied to extreme values as they have proven ineffective. Instead, our next hypotheses will broadly target mid-range neighborhoods that have previously shown robust output values, emphasizing slight variations and a strategic exploration of high-potential areas. By building on previously successful configurations, we aim to maximize the target function further.

## Iteration 42

As we analyze the accumulated experimental dataset, it continues to reaffirm that configurations predominantly within the mid-range values, particularly those that blend positive and negative inputs while emphasizing positive bias, have led to the highest target values. Configurations with negative inputs between -4 to -2 and positive values around 14 to 15 have repeatedly yielded superior outcomes. Results from extreme parameter settings persistently underperform, confirming the need to focus exclusively on mid-range explorations. Our next hypotheses will aim to build upon the configuration patterns that have demonstrated success, optimizing for improved performance while ensuring diversity.

## Iteration 59

As we conclude iteration 58, our comprehensive analysis of the experimental data emphasizes the effectiveness of mid-range configurations, particularly those incorporating a strong positive bias. The highest recorded target output is **6.622**, achieved through a configuration with negative inputs clustered around **-4 to -2** and positive values primarily between **14 to 15**. This confirms previous findings that maintaining well-balanced yet positively inclined parameter distributions significantly enhances outcomes. Detrimentally, configurations that center around extreme values—such as those near **-30** and **20**—continue to yield poor performance, with many outputs below **3**, solidifying the decision to exclude them from further exploration. Moving forward, we will focus on refining and diversifying our approaches within the identified high-performing regions, taking note of slight positive variations from previously established successful configurations. The next steps involve generating hypotheses that effectively retain favorable qualities while probing fresh combinations within the identified optimal ranges, specifically honing in on configurations that blend negative inputs around **-4 to -2** with positive inputs near **14 to 15** to discover potential maxima in the target function.

## Iteration 63

As we conclude iteration 62, our comprehensive analysis of the experimental data emphasizes the importance of mid-range configurations, particularly those incorporating strong positive inputs combined with carefully selected negative values. The highest observed target output is **6.622**, consistently achieved through configurations with negative inputs clustered between **-4 and -2** and positive values predominantly ranging from **14 to 15**. This pattern indicates that optimal configurations maintain a strong positive bias while incorporating a balance of negative values. Conversely, configurations leaning towards extreme values, such as those near **-30 and 20**, have persistently yielded low outputs below **3**, reinforcing their exclusion from any further hypotheses. The data clearly points towards the advantage of configurations that blend positive and mid-range negative influences. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses by enhancing combinations around these successful parameter neighborhoods, introducing slight variations and exploring new configurations within the established optimal ranges. This approach aims to discover even greater maxima in the target function by leveraging successful patterns observed in previous iterations while ensuring a balanced contribution from both positive and negative inputs.

## Iteration 98

As we approach iteration 97, our comprehensive dataset reveals critical insights into the optimization landscape tailored toward maximizing the target function. The highest observed target output is confirmed at **6.622**, consistently achieved with configurations that emphasize strong positive contributions combined with carefully balanced negative inputs. Specifically, successful configurations cluster around negative values between **-4 and -2** and positive values in the range of **14 to 15**. This pattern underscores the importance of maintaining a robust positive bias while effective balancing of negative parameters is crucial for superior performance. Notably, parameter settings near extreme values such as **-30** and **20** yield consistently poor results, with outputs below **3**, reinforcing their exclusion from future explorations. Moving forward, our hypotheses will continue to focus on slight variations of previously successful combinations within these favorable mid-range neighborhoods, ensuring diverse configurations that maintain a strong positive bias while critically managing the negative contributions. This structured approach aims to further refine our understanding of these interactions and maximize the target function effectively through informed adjustments.

## Iteration 102

As we refine our hypotheses based on the latest insights from our iterative experiments, we continue to concentrate on mid-range configurations that integrate strong positive inputs with strategically chosen negative values. The highest observed target output remains at **6.622**, consistently achieved with parameter settings that cluster around negative inputs between **-4 and -2** and positive inputs primarily in the range of **14 to 15**. Such configurations reveal the critical importance of a robust positive bias while effectively balancing negative contributions.

## Final Conclusions

As the optimization progressed through the iterative experiments, our hypotheses evolved significantly based on insights derived from the experimental data. Initially, the hypotheses aimed to uniformly explore extreme parameter values and mid-range configurations. However, repeated evaluations revealed a clear pattern: configurations with negative inputs clustered between -4 and -2 paired with positive values primarily ranging from 14 to 15 consistently yielded the highest target outputs. 

With this understanding, the focus shifted decisively toward refining combinations of these mid-range inputs, emphasizing strong positive biases while balancing negative influences. The shift entailed discarding extreme values entirely, as they proved detrimental to optimizing the target function.

Throughout the iterations, we systematically adjusted configurations, tested new combinations to avoid redundancy, and maintained a solid foundation in previously successful patterns. As a result, our hypotheses increasingly targeted high-performing parameter neighborhoods with variations in individual parameters to maximize function outputs.
