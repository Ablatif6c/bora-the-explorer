    "rationale": "Given that the function is a black-box and the search space for each parameter is symmetric and uniformly distributed between -30 and 20, a logical starting point for finding the maximum would be to choose the upper bound for all parameters. This is because a maximum is typically expected towards the higher end of the defined range when there are no additional constraints or information regarding the function behavior.",
