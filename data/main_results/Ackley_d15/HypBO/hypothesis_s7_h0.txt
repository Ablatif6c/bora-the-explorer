    "rationale": "Given the symmetry and potential for optimal values in the defined range, a point near the center of the bounds is often a reasonable starting guess. The midpoint of the bounds (-30, 20) for each parameter is calculated as (0.5 * (-30 + 20)) = -5. This suggests that values close to zero could yield favorable outcomes, as extreme values may lead to less optimal performance due to potential nonlinearities in the black-box function.",
