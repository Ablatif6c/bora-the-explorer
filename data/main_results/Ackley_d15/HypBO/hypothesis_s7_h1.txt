    "rationale": "Exploring values that are symmetrically away from the center can also be beneficial. A reasonable guess could be using the midpoint of the parameter range adjusted towards the upper bound, as many functions tend to have higher values at the edges of a defined range. Therefore, selecting values around (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) reduces the potential for negative impacts and might yield a higher target outcome, especially in multi-dimensional optimization contexts.",
