    "rationale": "Considering that complex functions can sometimes exhibit local maxima away from the boundaries, a middle-ground approach of setting parameters to a balanced value could also be effective. Choosing the midpoint of the bounds (-30, 20) which is -5 seems reasonable, as many functions have their maxima in the central region of the search space.",
