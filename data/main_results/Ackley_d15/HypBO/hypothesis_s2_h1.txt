    "rationale": "While the previous suggestion selected the upper bounds for all parameters, another reasonable choice could be selecting a point around the midpoint of the bounds. This could potentially capture variations in the black-box function, given that it may not be uniformly increasing. A point like (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10) allows for exploration around a central value and could reveal behaviors of the function that are not obvious at the extremes.",
