    "rationale": "Given that the parameters are bounded between -30 and 20, a reasonable guess for the global maximum of a mathematical black-box function is the upper bound. This is based on the assumption that the function increases within the given range. Therefore, selecting the maximum possible values for all variables should yield a high output, which can be adjusted based on actual experiment results.",
