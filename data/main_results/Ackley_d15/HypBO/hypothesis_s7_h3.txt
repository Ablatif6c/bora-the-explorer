    "name": "Midpoint Adjustment Strategy",
    "rationale": "An alternative strategy is to refine the midpoint approach by adjusting towards a balanced mix of negative and positive values, which may reveal interactions or features of the black-box function that are not apparent at extremes. Choosing values like (10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10) could allow exploration of the function's behavior across both ends of the spectrum while still centering around the key values within the constraints.",
