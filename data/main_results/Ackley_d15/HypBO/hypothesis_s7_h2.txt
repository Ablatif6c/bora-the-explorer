    "rationale": "In some optimization problems, especially those involving complex interactions, the global maximum can often be located near the upper bounds of the search space. Since the bounds are defined between -30 and 20, choosing values close to the upper limit may lead to identifying favorable regions. I propose a location of (15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15) as a plausible starting point to investigate potential peaks.",
