    "rationale": "To explore how the black-box function might behave under different configurations, I propose selecting a point that incorporates a mix of both extremes and midpoints across different parameters. By choosing values such as (-30, -10, 0, 10, 20, -20, 15, -5, 5, 0, 10, 20, -30, 15, -10), we may uncover potential local maxima that aren't immediately obvious from either the upper or lower bounds alone.",
