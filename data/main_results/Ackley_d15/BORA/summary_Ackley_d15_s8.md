# BORA for Target Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process successfully identified the maximum target value of 21.945, achieved through a refined zero-centered exploration hypothesis. This outcome underscores the importance of balanced parameter settings around zero, which facilitated favorable interactions among the parameters. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data allowed for a targeted exploration of the parameter space, ultimately leading to improved performance and insights into the underlying mathematical behavior of the black-box function.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this optimization process was to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization involved exploring a 15-dimensional parameter space defined by input variables \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20).

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
Before the optimization began, several hypotheses were formulated to guide the exploration of the parameter space:

1. **High Positive Exploration:** This hypothesis aimed to explore the upper bounds of the parameter space, where positive values might yield higher outputs due to potential nonlinearities in the function.
   
2. **Balanced Midpoint Exploration:** This hypothesis focused on sampling around the midpoint of the parameter space, hypothesizing that balanced values could provide a comprehensive view of the function's behavior.

3. **Negative Extremes Exploration:** This hypothesis investigated the lower bounds of the parameter space, where negative values might reveal interesting behaviors or local maxima.

4. **Diverse Random Sampling:** This hypothesis aimed to sample a diverse set of values across the parameter space to capture potential interactions and non-linearities in the function.

5. **Edge Case Exploration:** This hypothesis focused on sampling points at the edges of the parameter bounds, hypothesizing that boundary effects could reveal unexpected behaviors.

| 101       | Final confirmation of the refined zero-centered exploration as the best-performing hypothesis. |

**Hypothesis Evolution:**
Throughout the optimization process, hypotheses were refined based on the insights gained from experimental data. The refined zero-centered exploration hypothesis emerged as a standout performer, achieving the highest target value. Conversely, hypotheses targeting extreme negative values were largely discarded due to their consistently lower performance. The exploration of positive and negative mixes was retained but refined to avoid extremes, emphasizing the importance of careful selection of values.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**
Significant changes were made to the parameters during the optimization process. The vanilla BO adapted its search strategy based on observed outcomes, leading to a focus on balanced parameter settings around zero. This shift was driven by the consistent performance of the refined zero-centered exploration hypothesis, which highlighted the importance of favorable interactions among parameters.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best sample that resulted in the highest performance was achieved with the refined zero-centered exploration hypothesis, yielding a target value of 21.945 with the following parameters:

- \(x_0 = 0\)
- \(x_1 = 0\)
- \(x_2 = 0\)
- \(x_3 = 0\)
- \(x_4 = 0\)
- \(x_5 = 0\)
- \(x_6 = 0\)
- \(x_7 = 0\)
- \(x_8 = 0\)
- \(x_9 = 0\)
- \(x_{10} = 0\)
- \(x_{11} = 0\)
- \(x_{12} = 0\)
- \(x_{13} = 0\)
- \(x_{14} = 0\)

In contrast, the worst performance was observed with the negative extremes exploration hypothesis, which consistently yielded lower target values, indicating that these regions may be detrimental to performance.

The optimization outcomes align with known mathematical behaviors, particularly the tendency for functions to exhibit optimal behavior in regions of balance and symmetry. The findings suggest that the function may have favorable interactions among parameters when they are set around zero, leading to higher outputs.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Nonlinear Interactions:** Future experiments could focus on exploring nonlinear interactions among parameters, particularly in regions that have shown promise in this study.

2. **Adaptive Sampling Strategies:** Implementing more adaptive sampling strategies that dynamically adjust based on observed performance could enhance the efficiency of the optimization process.

3. **Broader Parameter Ranges:** Expanding the parameter ranges beyond the current bounds may reveal additional insights and potential maxima that were not captured in this study.

4. **Incorporation of Prior Knowledge:** Utilizing prior knowledge or domain expertise to inform the selection of initial hypotheses could lead to more targeted explorations and improved outcomes.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified the maximum target value of 21.945, achieved through a refined zero-centered exploration hypothesis. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data allowed for a targeted exploration of the parameter space, ultimately leading to improved performance and insights into the underlying mathematical behavior of the black-box function.
