## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). This extensive parameter space allows for a diverse exploration of potential configurations, which is crucial for uncovering the function's maximum.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this high-dimensional space. Initially, a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process, will be constructed based on a limited number of sampled points. This model will predict the function's behavior and uncertainty, guiding the selection of new points to evaluate. As the optimization progresses, BO will adaptively refine its search based on observed outcomes, balancing exploration of untested areas with exploitation of known high-performing regions.

When the optimization process plateaus—indicating diminishing returns from further evaluations—I will suggest targeted adjustments to the parameter settings. These suggestions will be based on the surrogate model's predictions and the identified conditions that maximize the target function, ensuring a thorough investigation of the parameter space and enhancing the likelihood of finding the optimal solution.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses generated focus on different combinations of parameters, considering potential interactions and promising areas that may yield high target values. By strategically selecting points across the defined bounds, we can effectively initiate the Bayesian Optimization process and set the stage for further exploration. The hypotheses include testing both extremes of the parameter space, balanced midpoints, and random configurations to capture a wide range of behaviors. This approach allows us to identify potential local maxima and understand the function's landscape better, ultimately guiding the optimization towards the global maximum.

## Iteration 14

As we continue with the Bayesian Optimization process, we have gathered insights from the previous iterations, particularly focusing on the promising configurations that yielded higher target values. The exploration of mid-range values has shown potential, especially in iteration 3, where a balanced configuration resulted in a target of 10.785. The recent iteration 13 also highlighted the effectiveness of mixed positive and negative values. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to explore these successful regions further while ensuring that we avoid previously tested configurations. The goal is to identify new combinations that may lead to even higher target values, leveraging the knowledge gained from past experiments.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring extreme values and balanced configurations, such as high positive and negative values. However, as the experiments progressed, it became evident that mid-range values, particularly around zero, yielded the highest target values, with the peak observed at 21.945 when all parameters were set to zero.

This realization prompted a shift in hypotheses towards fine-tuning around successful midpoints and exploring variations of balanced positive-negative combinations. The emphasis on avoiding extreme negative configurations, which consistently resulted in lower target values, became a guiding principle. Additionally, the exploration of new combinations that had not been tested previously was introduced to uncover potentially high-performing configurations.

As a result, the hypotheses transitioned from broad explorations of extremes to more targeted investigations of promising subspaces, focusing on mid-range values and balanced configurations. This iterative refinement allowed for a systematic approach to uncovering optimal parameter settings.
