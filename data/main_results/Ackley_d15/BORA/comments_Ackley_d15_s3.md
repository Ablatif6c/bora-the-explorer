## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). This extensive parameter space allows for a diverse exploration of potential configurations, which is crucial for uncovering the function's maximum.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this high-dimensional space. Initially, a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process, will be constructed based on a limited number of evaluations of the black-box function. This model will predict the function's behavior across the parameter space, allowing for informed decisions on where to sample next. As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance and suggest new points for evaluation, especially when the BO process plateaus, indicating a potential local maximum.

The intended outcome is to efficiently converge on the parameter settings that yield the highest function value, while minimizing the number of evaluations required. By leveraging the probabilistic nature of BO, we aim to balance exploration and exploitation, ultimately identifying the optimal conditions that maximize the target function.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses are designed to cover a range of values, including both extremes and midpoints, to capture potential nonlinear relationships among the parameters. By strategically selecting points, we can enhance the surrogate model's accuracy and improve the efficiency of the optimization process. The proposed hypotheses include sampling around the midpoints to identify central tendencies, exploring the boundaries to uncover extreme behaviors, and focusing on both positive and negative values to understand the function's dynamics. Additionally, random sampling will help discover unexpected regions of the parameter space. This comprehensive approach is expected to provide a robust foundation for the Bayesian Optimization process, allowing for effective exploration and exploitation of the parameter space to maximize the target function.

## Iteration 14

As we progress through iteration 13 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest target value observed so far is 5.852 from the first iteration, indicating that the parameter configuration around the midpoints of the bounds may hold promise. The data suggests that configurations with extreme values, particularly those near the boundaries, tend to yield lower target values, as seen in iterations 2 and 3, which resulted in targets of 2.060 and 3.560, respectively. The subspace around (x_0) and (x_1) values near zero appears to be more favorable, while configurations with extreme negative values for (x_4) and (x_5) have consistently resulted in lower targets. Iterations 6 through 13 have shown that exploring mid-range values and combinations can yield better results. Moving forward, we should refine our hypotheses to focus on these promising regions while discarding those that have not performed well. The next hypotheses will target mid-range values and combinations that have shown potential, while also introducing new exploratory points to ensure we cover the parameter space effectively.

## Iteration 54

As we reach iteration 53 of the Bayesian Optimization process, we have gathered a wealth of data that provides insights into the behavior of the black-box function. The highest target value observed is 13.136, achieved with a configuration of (x_0 = 1.632), (x_1 = 1.811), (x_2 = -5.037), and others. This suggests that the subspace around these values, particularly with moderate positive values for (x_0) and (x_1), is promising. Conversely, configurations with extreme values, especially those at the boundaries (e.g., (x_0 = -30) and (x_1 = -30)), have consistently yielded lower target values, often below 3.0.     Moving forward, we should refine our hypotheses to focus on the subspaces that have shown potential, particularly around moderate positive values and combinations that have yielded higher targets. We will discard hypotheses that have not performed well, such as those focusing solely on extreme boundaries or negative values that have not shown improvement. The next hypotheses will target the promising regions identified in the data while introducing new exploratory points to ensure comprehensive coverage of the parameter space. The emphasis will be on optimizing midpoints and moderate positive values, while also exploring specific negative values that have shown some potential.

## Iteration 93

As we reach iteration 92 of the Bayesian Optimization process, we have gathered a substantial dataset that reveals critical insights into the behavior of the black-box function. The highest target value observed is 17.196, achieved with a configuration of (x_0 = -1.000), (x_1 = 1.000), (x_2 = -2.000), and others. This suggests that the subspace around moderate positive values for (x_1) and specific negative values for (x_2) is particularly promising. Conversely, configurations with extreme values, especially those at the boundaries (e.g., (x_0 = -30) and (x_1 = -30)), have consistently yielded lower target values, often below 3.0. The data indicates that mid-range values, particularly for (x_0) and (x_1), combined with specific negative values for (x_2) and (x_4), tend to maximize the target. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to focus on these promising regions while discarding those that have not performed well, such as those focusing solely on extreme boundaries or negative values that have not shown improvement. The next hypotheses will target the identified subspaces that have shown potential, while also introducing new exploratory points to ensure comprehensive coverage of the parameter space.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the Bayesian Optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring a wide range of parameter values, including midpoints, boundaries, and random samples. The early iterations revealed that configurations around the midpoints yielded promising results, with the highest target observed being 5.852.

As the optimization progressed, we identified specific regions of the parameter space that consistently produced higher target values. For instance, moderate positive values for parameters \(x_0\) and \(x_1\) emerged as particularly effective, leading to a peak target of 17.196. This prompted a shift in our hypotheses to concentrate on these promising areas, while discarding configurations that relied solely on extreme values or negative parameters that did not yield improvements.

The hypotheses were refined to focus on optimized midpoints and targeted negative explorations, reflecting a more strategic approach to sampling. The confidence levels in the hypotheses increased as we gathered more data, particularly for those targeting moderate positive values and specific negative configurations that had shown potential.
