## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). This extensive parameter space allows for a diverse exploration of potential configurations, which is crucial given the complexity and unknown nature of the target function.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this high-dimensional parameter space. BO utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the function's behavior and guide the search for optimal parameters. Initially, a set of random points will be sampled to build a surrogate model, which will then be used to suggest new points for evaluation based on the expected improvement over the current best-known result.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance of the function and provide suggestions for new points to evaluate, especially when the BO process plateaus. This will involve identifying conditions or regions in the parameter space that show promise for maximizing the target. The intended outcome is to efficiently converge on the optimal parameter settings, thereby maximizing the target function while minimizing the number of evaluations needed.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the target function. The hypotheses generated focus on different combinations of parameters, considering potential interactions and promising regions. By sampling points that are spread across the defined bounds, we can better understand the function's behavior and identify areas that may lead to higher target values. The hypotheses include a central exploration to capture the general behavior of the function, boundary exploration to uncover extreme behaviors, and focused explorations on both negative and positive values to identify potential maxima. Additionally, a mixed values exploration is included to reveal complex interactions within the function. This comprehensive approach will enhance our understanding of the parameter space and guide subsequent evaluations effectively.
### Initial Hypotheses

- {'x_0': -20, 'x_1': -15, 'x_2': -10, 'x_3': -5, 'x_4': -20, 'x_5': -15, 'x_6': -10, 'x_7': -5, 'x_8': -20, 'x_9': -15, 'x_10': -10, 'x_11': -5, 'x_12': -20, 'x_13': -15, 'x_14': -10}

## Iteration 14

As we progress through iteration 13 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest target value observed so far is 4.893 from iteration 1, which remains the best result. The data indicates that points around the central region (e.g., iterations 1 and 5) tend to perform better, suggesting that this subspace may be more promising for maximizing the target. In contrast, the extreme boundaries, particularly combinations of negative values (e.g., iterations 2, 3, 9, and 10), consistently yield lower target values, indicating that these regions are detrimental to maximizing the target.     Moving forward, we should refine our hypotheses based on these observations. The previous hypotheses focusing solely on extreme boundaries or negative values can be discarded, as they have not shown promise. Instead, we should concentrate on exploring the central region further and consider mixed combinations that have previously yielded better results. The new hypotheses will aim to capitalize on the promising subspaces while avoiding the detrimental ones, thereby enhancing our chances of finding higher target values.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Refined Central Exploration

*Rationale:* Focusing on the central region where previous iterations yielded higher target values.

## Iteration 25

As we reach iteration 24 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered a wealth of data that provides insights into the behavior of the target function. The highest target value observed is 9.573 from iteration 20, indicating that the central region and mixed positive values are promising areas for maximizing the target. The data suggests that points around the central region, particularly those with a mix of positive and central values, consistently yield better results. Conversely, extreme negative values and combinations of negative parameters have proven detrimental, with several iterations yielding low target values, such as those from iterations 2, 3, 9, and 10. The exploration of slightly negative values has shown some potential, but overall, the focus should remain on the central and positive regions. Moving forward, I propose refining our hypotheses to concentrate on these successful subspaces while discarding those that have not yielded favorable results. New hypotheses will explore variations within the central and positive regions to further enhance our chances of finding higher target values.

## Iteration 80

As we reach iteration 79 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered a comprehensive dataset that reveals critical insights into the behavior of the target function. The highest target value observed is 14.166 from iteration 48, indicating that the central region and mixed positive values are the most promising areas for maximizing the target. Specifically, points around coordinates like (0, 5, 10) and (5, 10, 5) have consistently yielded better results, suggesting that the central and slightly positive regions are optimal for exploration. Conversely, extreme negative values and combinations of negative parameters have proven detrimental, with several iterations yielding low target values, particularly those from iterations 2, 3, 9, and 10. The exploration of slightly negative values has shown some potential, but overall, the focus should remain on the central and positive regions. Moving forward, I propose refining our hypotheses to concentrate on these successful subspaces while discarding those that have not yielded favorable results. The new hypotheses will explore variations within the central and positive regions to further enhance our chances of finding higher target values.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the Bayesian Optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the hypotheses were broad, exploring various regions of the parameter space, including central, boundary, and mixed values. However, as iterations progressed, it became clear that the central region and mixed positive values consistently yielded higher target values, particularly around coordinates like (0, 5, 10) and (5, 10, 5).

The data revealed that extreme negative values and combinations of negative parameters were detrimental to maximizing the target, leading to a shift in focus. As a result, hypotheses were refined to concentrate on the successful subspaces, discarding those that did not yield favorable results. This led to a more targeted exploration of the central and slightly positive regions, with slight variations introduced to further enhance the chances of finding higher target values.

By the end of the optimization, the hypotheses were more focused and confident, emphasizing the most promising areas identified through the iterative process. The confidence levels in the hypotheses increased as the optimization progressed, reflecting the growing understanding of the target function's behavior.
