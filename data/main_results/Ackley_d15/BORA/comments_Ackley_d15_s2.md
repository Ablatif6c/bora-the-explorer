## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). This extensive parameter space allows for a diverse exploration of potential configurations, which is crucial given the complexity and unknown nature of the target function.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this high-dimensional parameter space. BO utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the function's behavior and identify promising areas for evaluation. Initially, a set of random points will be sampled to build a surrogate model, which will then guide the selection of subsequent points based on an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance of the function and suggest new points for evaluation, especially when the BO process plateaus or shows diminishing returns. By identifying conditions that lead to improved outcomes, we aim to converge on the parameter settings that yield the maximum target value efficiently, leveraging the strengths of Bayesian Optimization to navigate the complexities of the black-box function.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses generated focus on different combinations of parameters, considering potential interactions and the overall landscape of the function. By strategically selecting points that span the bounds, we can better understand the function's behavior and identify promising areas for further exploration. The hypotheses include exploring the central region for balanced responses, targeting both extremes of the parameter space to uncover potential non-linearities, and employing random sampling to capture local optima. This comprehensive approach will enhance our understanding of the function and guide subsequent iterations of Bayesian Optimization effectively.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### Negative Extremes

*Rationale:* Exploring the lower bounds may uncover regions where the function behaves differently, potentially leading to unexpected maxima.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -30.0, 'x_1': -30.0, 'x_2': -30.0, 'x_3': -30.0, 'x_4': -30.0, 'x_5': -30.0, 'x_6': -30.0, 'x_7': -30.0, 'x_8': -30.0, 'x_9': -30.0, 'x_10': -30.0, 'x_11': -30.0, 'x_12': -30.0, 'x_13': -30.0, 'x_14': -30.0}

#### Mixed Extremes

*Rationale:* This point combines both high and low values, which may help identify interactions between parameters that influence the target function significantly.

*Confidence:* low

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 20.0, 'x_1': -30.0, 'x_2': 20.0, 'x_3': -30.0, 'x_4': 20.0, 'x_5': -30.0, 'x_6': 20.0, 'x_7': -30.0, 'x_8': 20.0, 'x_9': -30.0, 'x_10': 20.0, 'x_11': -30.0, 'x_12': 20.0, 'x_13': -30.0, 'x_14': 20.0}

#### Random Sampling

*Rationale:* This point is randomly selected within the bounds to ensure a diverse exploration of the parameter space, capturing potential local optima.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -10.5, 'x_1': 5.2, 'x_2': -15.3, 'x_3': 10.0, 'x_4': 0.0, 'x_5': -20.0, 'x_6': 15.0, 'x_7': -5.0, 'x_8': -10.0, 'x_9': -25.0, 'x_10': 10.0, 'x_11': -30.0, 'x_12': 5.0, 'x_13': -15.0, 'x_14': 20.0}

## Iteration 23

As we progress through iteration 22, the data reveals several insights into the behavior of the black-box function. The highest target value observed is 9.900 from iteration 9, indicating that the initial exploration of the parameter space was promising. Notably, the subspace around (x_0) values near -5 and (x_1) values around -5 seem to yield better results, particularly in iterations 1 and 14, which produced target values of 9.303 and 8.844, respectively. Conversely, extreme values such as -30 or 15 for all parameters consistently lead to lower target values, as seen in iterations 2 and 3, which yielded targets of 2.941 and 1.995.     The data suggests that combinations of moderate values across the parameters may be more beneficial than extreme configurations. The subspaces that maximize the target appear to cluster around the mid-range values, particularly where (x_0) and (x_1) are close to zero, while configurations with extreme negative values for multiple parameters tend to minimize the target.     Based on these findings, I propose to refine the previous hypotheses. The balanced midpoint exploration hypothesis remains relevant, but I will introduce new hypotheses that focus on the promising mid-range values and discard those that have consistently performed poorly. The new hypotheses will target specific combinations that have shown potential in the current dataset.

## Iteration 35

As we continue through the optimization process, the data from iterations 1 to 34 has provided significant insights into the behavior of the black-box function. The highest target value observed remains at 18.320 from iteration 26, indicating that exploring slightly negative values is a promising strategy. The subspace around (-1, -1) has shown strong potential, while configurations around (-5, -5) and mid-range positive values (5, 5) have also yielded competitive results. Conversely, extreme configurations consistently lead to lower target values, reinforcing the idea that moderate values are more beneficial. Moving forward, I propose new hypotheses that target specific combinations of parameters based on the insights gained from the current dataset, focusing on mid-range and slightly negative values to maximize the target effectively.

## Iteration 95

As we reach iteration 94, the data has provided significant insights into the behavior of the black-box function. The highest target value observed is 18.320 from iteration 26, which reinforces the effectiveness of exploring slightly negative values, particularly around (-1, -1). This subspace has shown strong potential, while configurations around (-5, -5) and mid-range positive values (5, 5) have also yielded competitive results. Conversely, extreme configurations, such as those with all parameters set to their bounds (e.g., 15 or -30), consistently lead to lower target values, indicating that moderate values are more beneficial. The data suggests that combinations of moderate values across the parameters may be more effective than extreme configurations. Moving forward, I propose refining the hypotheses to focus on the promising mid-range and slightly negative values while discarding those that have performed poorly, such as the high variability exploration. The new hypotheses will target specific combinations that have shown potential in the current dataset, particularly around the previously successful points. Additionally, the exploration of slightly positive values has also yielded some promising results, suggesting a balanced approach may be beneficial.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from the experimental data. Initially, the hypotheses focused on exploring a wide range of parameter values, including extreme configurations and random sampling. However, as the iterations progressed, it became clear that moderate values yielded better results, particularly around slightly negative values and mid-range configurations.

The highest target value observed was consistently around 18.320, achieved with parameters set to (-1, -1) across all dimensions. This finding prompted a shift in focus towards refining hypotheses that targeted slightly negative values and combinations of mid-range positive values. The exploration of extreme values was largely abandoned, as they consistently resulted in lower target values.

As the optimization advanced, hypotheses were adjusted to emphasize promising regions of the parameter space, discarding those that had performed poorly. The confidence in hypotheses targeting slightly negative values and balanced mid-range configurations increased, while confidence in extreme configurations decreased.
