# BORA for Target Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process successfully identified a maximum target value of 13.639 through a systematic exploration of the parameter space using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The most effective parameter combination involved mid-range values, particularly around zero and slightly positive inputs, which were refined throughout the iterations. This finding underscores the importance of targeted exploration in high-dimensional spaces, revealing that extreme values often detract from optimal outcomes.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this optimization process was to maximize a mathematical black-box function by identifying the optimal settings for 15 input parameters, each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20).

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
At the outset, five initial hypotheses were generated to explore diverse regions of the parameter space. These included:

1. **Center Exploration:** Focused on mid-range values to understand general behavior.
2. **Boundary Exploration:** Aimed to uncover extreme behaviors by sampling boundary values.
3. **Positive Cluster:** Concentrated on positive values to identify favorable regions.
4. **Negative Cluster:** Explored negative values to assess sensitivity.
5. **Mixed Strategy:** Combined positive and negative values to reveal interactions.

The rationale behind these hypotheses was based on the assumption that both extremes and central values could yield insights into the function's behavior, potentially leading to higher target values.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameter subspaces. The focus shifted from extreme values to mid-range combinations, particularly around zero and slightly positive values. This change was driven by the observation that extreme negative values consistently resulted in lower target outcomes, while mid-range values yielded higher targets. The final successful combination was (-3, 2, 4, 3, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1), which achieved the maximum target of 13.639.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing sample was identified as follows:

- **Best Sample:**  
  - Parameters: (-3, 2, 4, 3, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1)  
  - Target: 13.639

Conversely, the worst-performing sample was:

- **Worst Sample:**  
  - Parameters: (-30, 20, -30, 20, -30, 20, -30, 20, -30, 20, -30, 20, -30, 20, -30)  
  - Target: 2.060

The results align with known mathematical behaviors, where functions often exhibit peaks in mid-range values rather than at extremes. The exploration of mid-range values revealed unexpected interactions that significantly influenced the target outcome. This finding emphasizes the importance of targeted exploration in high-dimensional optimization problems.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Expanded Parameter Ranges:** Consider exploring a wider range of parameter values beyond the current bounds to identify potential peaks that may exist outside the defined limits.
2. **Adaptive Sampling Techniques:** Implement adaptive sampling strategies that dynamically adjust the exploration based on previous results, potentially leading to faster convergence on optimal values.
3. **Incorporation of Constraints:** Investigate the impact of additional constraints on the parameters, which may reveal new insights into the function's behavior.
4. **Multi-Objective Optimization:** Explore the possibility of optimizing multiple targets simultaneously, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the function's landscape.
5. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how variations in individual parameters affect the target outcome, which could inform more focused exploration strategies.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified a maximum target value of 13.639 through a rigorous exploration of the parameter space. The hypotheses evolved significantly, shifting from a broad exploration of extremes to a focused investigation of mid-range values. This iterative refinement led to a deeper understanding of the function's behavior and the identification of optimal parameter settings. The findings underscore the relevance of targeted exploration in mathematical optimization and provide a foundation for future experiments aimed at further enhancing our understanding of complex functions. The insights gained from this study will be invaluable for future mathematical experiments and theory development, particularly in high-dimensional optimization contexts.
