    "rationale":"In many mathematical functions, particularly those that are continuous and smooth, the maximum can often be found near the boundaries of the defined search space. Given the bounds of (-30, 20) for each parameter, I would suggest testing a point close to the maximum bound. This may guide the optimization process towards areas with potentially high function values.",
