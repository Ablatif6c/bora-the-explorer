    "rationale":"To maximize the score for hitting a target with a projectile, we need to consider both the launch parameters and the physics of projectile motion. A high launch angle (close to 45 degrees ideally, but slightly higher can help compensate for air resistance) is typically effective, especially with a strong initial velocity. A yaw angle of 0 degrees will keep the projectile aimed straight at the target. For speed, a value of around 30 m/s is often optimal for various projectiles in a typical range, while a moderate spin can stabilize the projectile. A higher release height (around 2 meters) can also improve accuracy as it increases the effective range. Mass impacts stability, and a mid-range value around 1 kg should suffice. Adjustments may need to be made empirically through the experiments, but this starting configuration aims to balance all aspects.",
