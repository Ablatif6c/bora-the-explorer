    "rationale":"To achieve maximum accuracy in throwing a projectile, we want to leverage optimal launch angles and speeds while ensuring minimal drag and optimal spin for stability. Based on physical principles, an approximately 45-degree pitch angle is generally effective for maximizing range in projectile motion. A yaw angle of 0 indicates straight aiming, which is ideal for targeting directly. The initial velocity (v0) should be high, but not so excessive that it causes instability; around 30 m/s can provide a good balance. A moderate spin (around 500 rpm) can help stabilize the projectile but not hinder its flight. For the spin axis, aligning it with the direction of flight (0 degrees) helps maintain stability. The height (h0) should be above ground level, around 1.5 m, to ensure it has a clear flight path, and a medium mass (2 kg) provides a good compromise between inertia and mobility.",
