    "rationale": "To maximize the projectile's score, a high launch angle (pitch_deg) combined with a reasonable initial speed (v0) and low mass is typically advantageous. A pitch around 45 degrees is generally optimal for maximizing horizontal distance on level ground, but since we need to account for target accuracy, a higher angle may help in achieving a greater vertical reach for hitting targets at varying heights. A yaw_deg close to 0 aligns the launch directly toward the target, minimizing angular error. High spin (spin_rpm) can stabilize and help control the projectile's flight. Adjusting h0 slightly above ground level allows for initial airborne conditions without grounding limitations. The optimum mass is generally less than the maximum to minimize inertia. Thus, I suggest a combination of these parameters for optimal performance.",
