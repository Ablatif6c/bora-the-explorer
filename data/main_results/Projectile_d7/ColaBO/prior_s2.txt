    "rationale":"To achieve the highest score, it is essential to maximize the range and accuracy of the projectile. A launch angle close to 45 degrees typically maximizes range for projectile motion, and a good initial speed can enhance this further. To account for air resistance, spin should be employed; high spin rates stabilize the projectile and improve its trajectory control. A lower mass will allow for easier manipulation of speed and spin. Furthermore, launching from a height above ground can assist in increasing the projectile's range. As such, I suggest the following parameters: pitch_deg = 45, yaw_deg = 0, v0 = 40, spin_rpm = 2000, spin_axis_deg = 0, h0 = 1.5, mass = 1.",
