    "rationale":"To maximize the score of hitting a target with a projectile, a good starting point would typically be a launch angle of around 45 degrees for optimal distance in ideal conditions. Setting the launch speed to a high yet manageable value (e.g. 30 m/s) will also help cover distance effectively. A pitch_deg of 45 allows for a good balance between height and distance. The yaw_deg can remain at 0 to aim directly at the target initially. A moderate spin (around 1000 RPM) can help stabilize the projectile in flight, and a spin_axis_deg of 0 aligns with the direction of motion. Releasing from a height of 1m can account for slight advantages in vertical distance. A mass of 1 kg should provide a good balance between inertia and acceleration for typical projectiles. Overall, these values provide a reasonable first guess for finding the global maximum score based on the physics of projectile motion.",
