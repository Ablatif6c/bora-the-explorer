    "rationale":"To maximize the score, we should consider optimal launch conditions typically found in projectile motion principles. A high launch angle (around 45 degrees) is usually efficient for maximum range, but in this case, we also need to account for the distance to the target. Given that the parameters include mass and height, a lower mass will provide better initial acceleration, and starting at a height may counteracts initial gravitational pull. Spinning the ball can stabilize its flight. Given these factors, a reasonable warm start could be a high pitch angle for more effective control and distance.",
