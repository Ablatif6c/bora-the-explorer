    "rationale": "For maximizing the score while aiming for a target located at (50, 0), a pitch angle of 35° offers a good trade-off for distance and height, as it allows the projectile to travel far while preventing it from going too high. Keeping the yaw at 0° ensures a direct throw towards the target. An initial velocity of 38 m/s provides sufficient speed to reach the target without overshooting. A spin rate of 800 rpm helps stabilize the projectile path while minimizing drag. A launch height of 0.8 m can optimize the initial conditions for the projectile's flight. A mass of 1 kg is ideal for achieving a balance between propulsion and aerodynamic effects.",
