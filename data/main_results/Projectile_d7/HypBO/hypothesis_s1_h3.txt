    "rationale": "To achieve a well-balanced throw, a pitch angle of approximately 35 degrees should be effective, providing a good combination of height and horizontal travel. The yaw angle at 0 degrees is still optimal for aiming straight at the target. An initial velocity of around 28 m/s strikes a balance between forceful enough to reach the target without overshooting. A spin rate of 800 rpm should be suitable for maintaining stability in flight while reducing air resistance effects. The spin axis at 0 degrees is recommended to ensure the trajectory remains directly aligned with the target. A height of 1.2 m gives a slight advantage, and a mass of 0.7 kg maximizes both distance and control during the throw.",
