    "rationale": "To achieve a balance between distance and accuracy, I suggest a pitch_deg of 40째, slightly below the classic 45째 to enhance control while still benefiting from elevation. A yaw_deg of 0째 continues to aim straight at the target. I recommend an initial velocity (v0) of 25 m/s, which is sufficient to reach the target with an appropriate projectile arc. A spin_rpm of 800 rpm should help stabilize the flight without excessive drag. The spin_axis_deg is kept at 0째 for direct trajectory alignment. A release height (h0) of 1 m will provide stability, and a mass (mass) of 2 kg allows for a good combination of throw power and control.",
