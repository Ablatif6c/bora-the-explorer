    "name": "Initial Estimate for Optimal Throw",
    "rationale": "Based on principles of projectile motion, a launch angle (pitch_deg) of around 45° is optimal for achieving maximum range in ideal conditions. A yaw_deg of 0° aims straight at the target. The initial velocity (v0) should be significant, so I estimate around 30 m/s for a good balance of distance and height. A modest spin (spin_rpm) can help stabilize the projectile; I suggest around 1000 rpm. Setting the spin_axis_deg to 0° aligns with the target direction. A release height (h0) of 1 m provides a slight advantage, and a moderate mass (mass) of 1 kg maintains reasonable dynamics for the throw.",
