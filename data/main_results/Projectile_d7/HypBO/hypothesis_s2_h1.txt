    "rationale": "Considering the physics of projectile motion and the need for stability during flight, we can adjust the parameters to focus on a slightly higher pitch to optimize for both range and height. A lower yaw angle keeps the aim aligned with the target, and a moderate initial velocity ensures enough distance without excessive loss to drag. The spin aids in flight stabilization while maintaining a lightweight projectile for maximum efficiency.",
