    "name": "Balanced Launch Configuration",
    "rationale": "To achieve optimal performance in hitting the target, a launch angle of around 55 degrees is favorable as it maximizes the height and distance traveled before descending. Keeping the yaw at 0 degrees aims the projectile straight toward the target. An initial velocity of 32 m/s is sufficient to cover the required distance with precision. A spin rate of approximately 1300 rpm helps stabilize the projectile's flight pattern. Launching from a height of around 1.2 meters provides an advantageous elevation improving both range and accuracy. A mass of 0.75 kg strikes a balance between speed and stability.",
