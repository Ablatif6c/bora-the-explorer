    "rationale": "Aiming for a pitch of around 35 degrees can strike a balance between height and distance for optimal projectile motion, as it allows for a good trajectory towards the target. Keeping the yaw at zero ensures a straight throw, minimizing lateral drift. A slightly higher initial velocity of around 42 m/s increases the range effectively. The spin should be moderate to enhance stability, while the mass should remain on the lighter side for better acceleration.",
