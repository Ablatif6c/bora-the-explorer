    "name": "Optimal Projectile Parameters",
    "rationale": "To maximize the score in hitting the target at (50, 0), the projectile needs to be launched at a suitable angle and speed. A pitch of around 45° is generally optimal for range in projectile motion. The yaw should be 0° to aim straight at the target. A higher initial velocity (e.g., around 40 m/s) contributes to better distance. Spin can stabilize the projectile, but at high speeds might not significantly impact distance. Setting a reasonable spin around 1500 rpm is a balance between stability and performance. Launching from a height of about 1 m can also help, as it increases the launch range. The mass can be set to 1 kg, which is a manageable weight for a projectile.",
