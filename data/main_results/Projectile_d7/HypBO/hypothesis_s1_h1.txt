    "rationale": "Aiming for maximum accuracy, a pitch angle of about 40 degrees is likely to provide a good launch trajectory, allowing for both sufficient height and horizontal coverage towards the target. The yaw angle should still be set to 0 degrees for direct aiming at the target. A slightly higher initial velocity of around 30 m/s could result in a better reach given that it compensates for the height and distance to the target effectively. Keeping the spin at 1500 rpm should add beneficial gyroscopic stability without introducing excessive deviation. The spin axis should again be aligned with the x-axis for optimal straight-line travel. A launch height of 1.5 m can leverage an initial elevation advantage, while using a mass of approximately 0.5 kg aids in minimizing drag and maximizing distance.",
