    "name": "Projectile Launch Optimization",
    "rationale": "Based on the physics of projectile motion, an upward launch angle around 30° is commonly effective for achieving a good balance between vertical and horizontal distance for shorter throws aimed at a target. Keeping the yaw at 0° ensures the throw is aimed directly at the target. An initial velocity of approximately 35 m/s can provide sufficient speed to reach the target. The spin at 1000 rpm may help in maintaining a stable flight path without causing excessive drag. A height of 1.5 m can potentially give better distance due to reduction in required launch angle. Choosing a mass of 2 kg offers a decent compromise between inertia and the capacity to maintain speed.",
