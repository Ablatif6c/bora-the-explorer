    "rationale": "To optimize the throw for hitting the target accurately, a pitch angle of 55 degrees maximizes height but also allows for sufficient range when combined with a moderate initial velocity. A yaw angle of 0 degrees ensures a direct aim towards the target. Setting the initial velocity at 35 m/s strikes a balance between distance and control, while a mass of 1.5 kg provides stability during flight. A release height of 1 meter gives some benefit from being above ground level while not being too high to waste energy. A minimal spin rate of 10 RPM keeps the flight path straightforward and manageable.",
