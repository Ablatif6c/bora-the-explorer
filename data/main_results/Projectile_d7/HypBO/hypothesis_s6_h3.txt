    "name": "Refined Guess for Improved Accuracy",
    "rationale": "This guess considers a slight adjustment to compensate for potential projectile drop over distance. A pitch angle of 52 degrees could provide optimal altitude with respectable distance. Maintaining a yaw of 0 keeps the aim targeted straight at the objective. An initial velocity of 42 m/s would offer sufficient speed to enhance the projectile's reach. The spin can be set at 1300 RPM to promote better gyroscopic stability during flight. Launching from a height of 1.3m can aid in achieving a smoother path towards the target. Finally, a mass of 0.7 kg should offer a good balance between velocity and control throughout the trajectory.",
