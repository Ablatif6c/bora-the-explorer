    "name": "Balanced Trajectory Approach",
    "rationale": "A balanced strategy for maximizing the score would involve a slightly lower pitch angle to ensure a good trade-off between distance and height. A pitch of 40 degrees allows the projectile to travel further horizontally while still ascending sufficiently to avoid falling short of the target. Keeping the yaw at 0 ensures direct targeting. An initial velocity of 38 m/s is sufficient for achieving a strong range without excess that could lead to instability. Minimizing spin maintains a clean, predictable trajectory, while a moderate release height of 1 m helps optimize launch conditions. I suggest using a mass of around 2 kg to strike a balance between inertia and distance.",
