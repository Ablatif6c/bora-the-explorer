    "rationale": "To maximize the score, we need to balance height and distance. A pitch around 40 degrees can provide a good trajectory that allows enough time for the projectile to travel forward towards the target while still gaining some vertical height. A slight yaw to the right can compensate for potential lateral drift. A higher initial velocity will help reach the target faster, while an optimal spin will stabilize the projectile's flight path.",
