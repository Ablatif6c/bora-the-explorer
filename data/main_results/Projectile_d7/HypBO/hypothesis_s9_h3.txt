    "rationale": "Choosing a pitch angle of 30 degrees allows for a lower flight arc, reducing air resistance and providing good accuracy towards the target. A yaw of 0 degrees aims the projectile directly at the target. An initial velocity of 32 m/s offers a powerful throw that balances distance and time in the air. A spin rate of 600 RPM ensures stability while minimizing deviation from the intended path. Launching from a height of 0.5 meters maintains proximity to the ground for a more direct trajectory. A mass of 0.5 kg allows for quicker velocity response without excessive weight.",
