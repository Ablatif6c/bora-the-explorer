    "name": "High-Angle Accurate Launch Strategy",
    "rationale": "Utilizing a pitch angle of 50 degrees can help in achieving a better vertical reach while still allowing the projectile to travel a sufficient horizontal distance towards the target. A yaw of 0 degrees ensures it is aimed directly at the target. An initial velocity of 28 m/s combines a reasonable speed that keeps the projectile stable in its flight path. A spin of 800 RPM enhances the stability against disturbances during flight. Launching from a height of 2 meters takes advantage of additional drop distance to align better with the target's distance. A mass of 1.5 kg optimizes the projectile's inertia without significantly affecting the dynamics.",
