    "name": "Optimal Throw Parameters",
    "rationale": "Based on the physics of projectile motion, an optimal solution is likely to involve a moderate downward launch angle for maximum horizontal distance. A yaw angle of 0 degrees aims straight at the target, with an initial velocity around 30 m/s, sufficient enough to reach the distance with an appropriate trajectory. Using a mass that is non-negligible would help maintain stability, and direct spin is minimized as it may not significantly enhance the distance to the target. The height of release at 1 meter is a good compromise to account for any launch dynamics.",
