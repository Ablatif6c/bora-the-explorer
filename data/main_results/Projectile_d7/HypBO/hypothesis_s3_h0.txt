    "rationale": "To maximize the score, it's essential to achieve a balance between launch angle, initial velocity, and other rotational and positional factors. Experimentally, a launch angle around 45 degrees tends to yield the best distances in projectile motion. A yaw of 0 degrees means the projectile is aimed directly at the target. A high initial velocity maximizes distance, while moderate spin can stabilize the projectile. Releasing from a small height (0.5m) helps utilize gravitational effects without excessive descent time. Choosing a mass just heavy enough (1kg) to keep it stable yet allow for substantial speed is optimal.",
