    "rationale": "The optimal throwing parameters should consider effective projectile motion principles. A launch angle of 45 degrees remains optimal for maximizing distance toward the target, while a yaw of 0 degrees ensures it goes directly toward the target without drift. A high initial velocity (around 40 m/s) creates sufficient range, while an optimal spin rate (around 1500 rpm) can stabilize the projectile's flight, enhancing accuracy. Launching from a height of about 1.5m allows for enhanced range due to the additional gravitational potential energy, and a lightweight projectile (0.5 kg) aids in achieving high speeds.",
