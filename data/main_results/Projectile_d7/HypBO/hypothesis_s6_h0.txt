    "name": "Initial Guess for Global Maximum",
    "rationale": "To maximize the score, the projectile should be launched at a high enough initial velocity and at an optimal angle to achieve a good trajectory toward the target. A launch angle around 45 degrees is often considered ideal for distance, but since we're aiming at a target 50m away, we may need to slightly adjust this angle. A yaw angle of 0 should keep the projectile aimed directly at the target. A moderate spin can stabilize the projectile, hence a spin of around 1000 RPM is a good start. The initial height can help with distance covered, so 1m is chosen. The mass should be low enough not to impede acceleration but high enough for stability; hence, 1 kg is reasonable. Thus, the optimal point may roughly be heeded from physics principles and empirical knowledge of projectile motion.",
