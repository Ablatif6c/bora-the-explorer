    "rationale": "To maximize the score, it is essential to consider both the angle and the velocity. A pitch angle of around 50 degrees may provide a good balance between height and horizontal distance. Maintaining a straight aim (yaw of 0) targets the projectile directly at the target. Using a higher initial velocity close to the upper bound, such as 45 m/s, helps cover the distance more effectively. A spin of around 1500 RPM will assist in stabilizing trajectory without overspin. Releasing from a height of 0.5 meters provides a slight advantage due to reduced air resistance for the initial horizontal position. A projectile mass of 0.5 kg achieves a good compromise between being light enough to throw fast and heavy enough to maintain stability. This combination is anticipated to yield a high score.",
