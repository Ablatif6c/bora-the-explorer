    "rationale": "The combination of launch parameters should effectively utilize projectile motion for optimal accuracy towards the target. A launch angle of around 50 degrees can provide a good balance between height and distance. A yaw of 0 degrees directs the throw straight towards the target. A moderately high initial velocity of about 35 m/s facilitates a significant range. Setting the spin rate to around 1200 rpm can enhance stability during flight. Releasing the projectile from a height of 1 meter maximizes both the potential energy at launch and the time in the air for accurate landing. A mass of 0.8 kg is sufficient to maintain velocity while ensuring enough control.",
