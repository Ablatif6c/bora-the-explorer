    "name": "Alternative High-Speed Throw Estimate",
    "rationale": "Considering that a higher initial velocity can significantly increase the range, I propose an aggressive initial velocity (v0) of 40 m/s, which should maximize the distance covered. Maintaining a pitch_deg of 35째 is slightly lower than the optimal 45째 to balance the projectile's arc with high-speed trajectory. A yaw_deg of 0째 continues to aim straight at the target. Setting spin_rpm to 1500 rpm should provide good stability during flight. The spin_axis_deg remains at 0째 for a direct throw, while a release height (h0) of 1.5 m can leverage the increased device height for better trajectory upon release. The mass (mass) of 0.5 kg could support a faster throw without overly complicating dynamics.",
