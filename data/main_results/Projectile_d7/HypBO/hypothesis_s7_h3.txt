    "name": "High Angle Precision Strategy",
    "rationale": "Maximizing score may also benefit from utilizing a higher pitch angle for more vertical lift. A pitch of 55 degrees can allow the projectile to reach a higher apex before descending towards the target, helping to minimize horizontal distance travel errors. The yaw should remain at 0 to ensure direct targeting toward (50, 0). A slightly lower initial velocity of around 35 m/s will help control the projectileâ€™s flight path more clearly, while enabling sufficient range. A spin of 200 rpm provides stability without excessive complexity in trajectory, and releasing the projectile from a height of 1.2 m helps optimize the launch. The mass is set to 1 kg to provide a good balance of momentum and control.",
