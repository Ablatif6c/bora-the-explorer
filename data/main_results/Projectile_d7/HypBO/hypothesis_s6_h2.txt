    "name": "Optimized Guess for Target Accuracy",
    "rationale": "For this iteration, I recommend a launch angle of 55 degrees, which may help to achieve a balance between height and distance. Keeping the yaw at 0 ensures that the projectile heads directly toward the target, while an initial velocity of 35 m/s can still provide substantial distance with reasonable control. Increasing the spin to 1200 RPM can enhance flight stability and reduce wobble, which is crucial for accuracy. A launch height of 1.2m could help with trajectory dynamics, allowing the projectile to descend toward the target more effectively. A mass of 0.8 kg strikes a good balance between speed and control, allowing the projectile to carry forward the necessary momentum.",
