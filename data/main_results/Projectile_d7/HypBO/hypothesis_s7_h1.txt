    "name": "High Velocity Option",
    "rationale": "Considering the physics of projectile motion, achieving a high score involves balancing elevation and distance. A pitch angle of 50 degrees is slightly higher than 45 and helps achieve better height, which can increase range due to gravitational effects. The yaw should remain at 0 to maintain a direct aim at the target. Setting the initial velocity close to the maximum allows for a longer flight time before hitting the ground, while minimal spin can maintain a stable trajectory. A release height of 1.5 meters and a mass around 0.5 kg keeps the projectile manageable yet effective for distance.",
