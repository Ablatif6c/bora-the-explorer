    "rationale": "Considering the physics of projectile motion, a pitch angle of 40 degrees effectively balances the vertical and horizontal components of velocity, allowing for a long-range throw. A zero yaw angle optimally aims toward the target, ensuring accuracy. An initial velocity of 37 m/s should provide sufficient force to reach 50 meters while maintaining a controlled trajectory. A mass of 1 kg is chosen for its optimal acceleration and stability in the air. A release height of 2 meters takes advantage of increased initial vertical height, and a low spin rate (around 50 RPM) may help stabilize the projectile without overly complicating its flight path.",
