    "name": "Optimal Projectile Parameters",
    "rationale": "To maximize the score, we need to send the projectile towards the target at (50, 0) with an optimal combination of angle, velocity, and spin. A pitch angle around 45 degrees typically maximizes distance for projectile motion, while a yaw of 0 degrees targets directly towards the target. A higher initial velocity (within limits) will help reach the target distance. Minimal spin and a moderate height will help keep the trajectory stable. Thus, I suggest the following parameters.",
