# Projectile

## Experiment Overview

The experiment aims to maximize the score, which reflects the accuracy of a projectile thrown from the origin (0, 0) toward a target located at (50, 0). The score is derived from the distance error between the projectile's landing position and the target, with higher scores indicating closer landings. 

To achieve this, we will optimize several parameters: pitch_deg (release angle), yaw_deg (horizontal aiming angle), v0 (initial velocity), spin_rpm (spin rate), spin_axis_deg (orientation of the spin axis), h0 (release height), and mass of the projectile. Each parameter has defined bounds, ensuring a systematic exploration of the parameter space while adhering to physical constraints.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to efficiently navigate this multi-dimensional space, leveraging a probabilistic model to predict the score based on current parameter settings. As BO iteratively samples points, it will refine its understanding of the landscape, focusing on areas with high potential for improvement. When BO plateaus, I will suggest targeted adjustments to the parameters, based on observed trends and conditions that have previously maximized the score, ensuring a thorough exploration and optimization of the projectile's launch settings.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising configurations for maximizing the score. The hypotheses consider various physical principles, such as optimal launch angles and velocities, as well as the effects of spin and mass on projectile motion. A moderate launch angle (around 20 degrees) is often effective for maximizing range, while a low pitch angle with high initial velocity may help achieve a flatter trajectory, potentially reducing distance error. Additionally, a high pitch angle combined with significant spin may stabilize the projectile and improve accuracy. A balanced configuration with moderate parameters can yield consistent results across trials, allowing for gradual improvements. Lastly, using a low mass with high spin may enhance control and accuracy, potentially reducing distance error significantly. By sampling these points, we can gather insights into the relationships between parameters and their impact on the score, guiding further optimization efforts.
### Initial Hypotheses

*Rationale:* A low pitch angle with high initial velocity may help achieve a flatter trajectory, potentially reducing distance error.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'pitch_deg': 10, 'yaw_deg': 15, 'v0': 45, 'spin_rpm': 1000, 'spin_axis_deg': 90, 'h0': 0.5, 'mass': 0.5}

#### Vertical Launch with Spin

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'pitch_deg': 80, 'yaw_deg': 0, 'v0': 25, 'spin_rpm': 2500, 'spin_axis_deg': 0, 'h0': 2, 'mass': 0.1}

## Iteration 13

As we progress through iteration 12, the data reveals significant insights into the parameter space. The highest score achieved so far is 80.00 at iteration 6, with a pitch_deg of 18.66, yaw_deg of 1.38, and an initial velocity (v0) of 29.27. This suggests that a moderate pitch angle combined with a reasonable velocity can yield favorable results. Conversely, configurations with extreme angles (e.g., iterations 3, 8, 9, 10, and 11) have consistently resulted in low scores, indicating that both high pitch angles and extreme yaw angles are detrimental to performance. The subspace around pitch_deg 18-20 and v0 around 25-30 appears promising, while configurations with high spin rates and extreme yaw angles should be avoided. Iterations 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11 yielded scores below 2, indicating that these parameter settings are less effective. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly and proposing new ones that focus on the successful regions identified.

Conversely, configurations with extreme angles, particularly high pitch angles (above 75 degrees) and extreme yaw angles, have consistently resulted in low scores, indicating they are detrimental to performance. The data also suggests that lower mass configurations have not yielded significant improvements, as seen in iterations 22-27, which consistently scored below 5. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly and proposing new ones that focus on the successful regions identified. The next steps will involve exploring variations within the promising subspaces while avoiding configurations that have previously led to low scores.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses were broad, exploring various configurations across the parameter space. However, as iterations progressed, it became clear that certain parameter ranges yielded consistently higher scores, particularly around moderate pitch angles (18-20 degrees) and initial velocities (28-34 m/s). 

The highest score achieved was 84.42, which reinforced the effectiveness of moderate parameters. Consequently, hypotheses were refined to focus on these successful regions, discarding configurations that resulted in low scores, especially those with extreme angles or high spin rates. The emphasis shifted towards balancing pitch, velocity, and spin to stabilize the projectile while maximizing distance accuracy.

As the optimization progressed, confidence in the hypotheses fluctuated based on their performance. High-confidence hypotheses were those that consistently yielded scores above 60, while lower confidence was assigned to configurations that performed poorly or yielded minimal improvements.

The following table summarizes the evolution of confidence in the hypotheses throughout the optimization:

| Hypothesis Name                          | Initial Confidence | Final Confidence |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Optimized Moderate Launch                | High               | High             |
| Higher Velocity with Moderate Pitch      | Medium             | Medium           |
| Controlled Low Angle with Increased Velocity | Medium         | Medium           |
| Moderate Parameters with Balanced Spin   | Low                | Medium           |
| Exploring Lower Pitch with Moderate Velocity | Medium         | Medium           |
| New Configuration with Slightly Higher Mass | Low              | Medium           |

This iterative refinement process allowed for a more targeted approach, ultimately leading to improved performance in maximizing the score.
