# Projectile

## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to maximize the score, which reflects the accuracy of a projectile thrown towards a target located at (50, 0). The score is derived from the distance error between the projectile's landing position and the target, with higher scores indicating closer landings. To achieve this, we will optimize several parameters that influence the projectile's trajectory: 

1. **pitch_deg**: Release angle (bounds: -30° to 90°)
2. **yaw_deg**: Horizontal aiming angle (bounds: -180° to 180°)
3. **v0**: Initial velocity (bounds: 0 to 50 m/s)
4. **spin_rpm**: Spin rate (bounds: 0 to 3000 RPM)
5. **spin_axis_deg**: Orientation of the spin axis (bounds: -180° to 180°)
6. **h0**: Release height (bounds: 0 to 2 m)
7. **mass**: Projectile mass (bounds: 0.01 to 10 kg)

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to systematically explore this multi-dimensional parameter space. BO will iteratively suggest parameter settings based on previous outcomes, focusing on areas that show promise for maximizing the score. When BO plateaus, I will provide insights to explore alternative parameter combinations or adjust the exploration-exploitation balance, ensuring we identify optimal conditions for achieving the highest score. The intended outcome is to refine the projectile's launch parameters to achieve maximum accuracy in hitting the target.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising trajectories for maximizing the score. The hypotheses are designed to cover a range of angles, velocities, and other parameters that could influence the projectile's landing position. By strategically selecting points that vary in pitch, yaw, and initial velocity, we can gather valuable data on how these parameters interact and affect the distance error. The maximum score of 100 indicates a perfect landing on the target, and our goal is to identify parameter settings that minimize the distance error. The proposed hypotheses include a mix of moderate and extreme values for pitch and velocity, as well as varying spin rates to assess their impact on stability and accuracy. This approach will help refine our understanding of the optimal conditions for hitting the target effectively.

## Iteration 12

As we progress through iteration 11 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest score observed so far is 76.20 from iteration 4, achieved with a high pitch angle (80°) and maximum initial velocity (50 m/s). This suggests that launching the projectile at a steep angle with sufficient velocity can significantly improve accuracy. Conversely, several hypotheses, particularly those with low pitch angles and extreme yaw angles (e.g., iterations 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10), have resulted in low scores, indicating that these configurations are detrimental to hitting the target. The data suggests that the most promising subspace for maximizing the score lies within moderate to high pitch angles (30° to 80°) and initial velocities (30 m/s to 50 m/s). In contrast, configurations with low initial velocities and extreme yaw angles should be avoided. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly and proposing new ones that align with the successful parameters identified. The focus will be on high pitch angles combined with high initial velocities, as well as exploring the effects of spin rates on stability and accuracy.

## Iteration 28

As we continue with the Bayesian Optimization process, the insights from previous iterations remain crucial for refining our hypotheses. The highest score recorded is still 76.20, achieved with a high pitch angle and maximum initial velocity. This reinforces the importance of steep launch angles and high velocities in maximizing accuracy. The data indicates that configurations with low pitch angles and extreme yaw angles are consistently detrimental. The promising subspaces for maximizing the score are within high pitch angles (70° to 85°) and high initial velocities (40 m/s to 50 m/s). The refined hypotheses will focus on these parameters while exploring variations in spin rates and yaw angles to optimize the projectile's trajectory further. The next steps will involve testing configurations that maintain high pitch angles while varying the initial velocity and spin rates to assess their impact on accuracy.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the Bayesian Optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses were diverse, exploring a wide range of parameters, including various pitch angles, yaw angles, initial velocities, spin rates, and masses. The early iterations revealed that high pitch angles (around 80°) and maximum initial velocities (50 m/s) were crucial for achieving higher scores, with the best score recorded being 76.20.

As the optimization progressed, the focus shifted towards refining these successful configurations. Hypotheses began to concentrate on high pitch angles (70° to 85°) and high initial velocities (40 m/s to 50 m/s), while also exploring the effects of spin rates and yaw angles. The data consistently indicated that low pitch angles and extreme yaw angles were detrimental to performance, leading to the exclusion of such configurations in later hypotheses.

By the final iterations, the hypotheses were more targeted, emphasizing high pitch angles with moderate to high velocities, while also testing variations in spin rates to assess their impact on stability and accuracy. This iterative refinement process allowed for a more systematic exploration of the parameter space, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the optimal conditions for maximizing the score.
