# Projectile

## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to maximize the score, which reflects the accuracy of a projectile thrown from the origin (0, 0) toward a target located at (50, 0). The score is derived from the distance error between the projectile's landing position and the target, with higher scores indicating closer landings. 

To achieve this, we will optimize several parameters: pitch_deg (release angle), yaw_deg (horizontal aiming angle), v0 (initial velocity), spin_rpm (spin rate), spin_axis_deg (orientation of the spin axis), h0 (release height), and mass of the projectile. Each parameter has defined bounds, ensuring a systematic exploration of the parameter space while adhering to physical constraints.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to efficiently navigate this multi-dimensional space, leveraging a probabilistic model to predict the score based on parameter settings. As BO iteratively samples points, it will update its model and suggest new configurations. When the optimization process plateaus, I will provide insights to explore unexplored regions or adjust parameters strategically, aiming to identify conditions that yield the highest scores. Ultimately, the experiment seeks to determine the optimal parameter settings for achieving maximum accuracy in hitting the target.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to identify promising configurations for maximizing the score. The hypotheses consider various physical principles, such as optimal launch angles and velocities, as well as the effects of spin and mass on projectile motion. A high launch angle (around 75°) is expected to maximize vertical distance, allowing the projectile to cover more horizontal distance before descending. Conversely, a low launch angle (around 15°) combined with a high initial velocity may allow the projectile to travel quickly and effectively minimize distance error. Additionally, using moderate values for all parameters may provide a balanced trajectory, while increasing the spin rate could enhance stability and accuracy. Aiming for maximum height with a low mass projectile may also allow for a longer hang time, giving it more time to travel horizontally before descending. By strategically selecting points across the parameter bounds, we can gather valuable data to inform the Bayesian Optimization process and refine our search for the best parameter settings.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### High Launch Angle with Moderate Velocity

*Rationale:* A high launch angle (around 75°) is expected to maximize vertical distance, allowing the projectile to cover more horizontal distance before descending. Coupled with a moderate initial velocity, this may yield a good balance for reaching the target.

#### Balanced Approach with Moderate Parameters

*Rationale:* Using moderate values for all parameters may provide a balanced trajectory, allowing for a stable flight path that could lead to a closer landing to the target.

#### High Spin for Stability

*Rationale:* Increasing the spin rate (around 2500 RPM) may enhance the stability of the projectile in flight, potentially improving accuracy and reducing distance error.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'pitch_deg': 60, 'yaw_deg': 10, 'v0': 35, 'spin_rpm': 2500, 'spin_axis_deg': 45, 'h0': 1.5, 'mass': 0.8}

*Confidence:* low

*Points:*

- {'pitch_deg': 85, 'yaw_deg': 0, 'v0': 20, 'spin_rpm': 2000, 'spin_axis_deg': 0, 'h0': 2, 'mass': 0.01}

## Iteration 12

Analyzing the results from the first 11 iterations, the highest score achieved is 76.08 from iteration 3, with parameters: pitch_deg of 45, yaw_deg of 0, v0 of 25, spin_rpm of 500, spin_axis_deg of 90, h0 of 1, and mass of 2. This indicates that a moderate launch angle and velocity, combined with a reasonable mass, can lead to effective projectile performance. Conversely, configurations with extreme angles (like pitch_deg of 85 in iteration 5) or very low velocities (like v0 of 5.13 in iteration 9) resulted in significantly lower scores, indicating that these subspaces are detrimental. The data suggests that the optimal subspace for maximizing score lies around moderate pitch angles (30° to 60°) and moderate velocities (20 m/s to 35 m/s). In light of these findings, I propose refining our hypotheses to focus on these promising regions while discarding those that have consistently performed poorly. New hypotheses will explore variations within the successful parameter ranges identified, particularly emphasizing moderate launch angles and velocities, while also considering adjustments in spin and mass to enhance stability and accuracy.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of parameter settings, including extreme angles and velocities. However, as the experiments progressed, it became clear that moderate launch angles (around 30° to 60°) and velocities (20 m/s to 35 m/s) yielded the highest scores, particularly the score of 76.08 achieved in iteration 3.

In response to these findings, subsequent hypotheses were refined to concentrate on these promising regions of the parameter space. The focus shifted towards exploring variations within moderate pitch angles and velocities while also considering adjustments in spin and mass to enhance stability and accuracy. For instance, hypotheses began to incorporate slight yaw adjustments to fine-tune trajectories and test lower mass configurations to potentially improve hang time and horizontal distance.

As the optimization progressed, confidence in the hypotheses fluctuated based on their performance. Hypotheses that consistently yielded low scores were discarded, while those that showed promise were further explored with slight modifications. This iterative process allowed for a more targeted approach, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the parameter relationships that maximize the score.
