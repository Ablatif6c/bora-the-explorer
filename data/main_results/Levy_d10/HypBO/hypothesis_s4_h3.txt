    "rationale": "By selecting a mix of positive and negative values, such as (3.0, -3.0, 3.0, -3.0, 3.0, -3.0, 3.0, -3.0, 3.0, -3.0), we can explore how the function behaves with oscillating values. This choice attempts to capture interactions between parameters that can lead to interesting peaks or valleys in the optimization landscape.",
