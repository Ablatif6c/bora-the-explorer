    "rationale": "Given the symmetric bounds of the parameters and typical behaviors of black-box functions, I hypothesize that the global maximum may occur near the center of the search space. Therefore, I suggest trying the midpoint of the bounds for all parameters, which would be (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). This is often a reasonable starting point as many mathematical functions have their optimum near such central values.",
