    "rationale": "Given the symmetry and uniform bounds of the parameters, a reasonable initial guess for the maximum point is at the center of the search space. This is due to common behavior in mathematical functions, where extremes often cluster around the center, particularly within defined bounds. The value of zero for all parameters can generally be expected to yield a good starting point.",
