    "rationale": "Considering the potential complexity of the function and patterns that may occur, an interesting point to evaluate might be the midpoint of the positive and negative bounds. Therefore, I suggest (5, -5, 5, -5, 5, -5, 5, -5, 5, -5). This guess alternates between high and low values, which could capture interesting behavior of the function while still exploring the broader space.",
