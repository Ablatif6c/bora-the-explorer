    "rationale": "In many optimization problems, especially symmetric mathematical functions, extrema often occur at the corners of the search space. Therefore, I suggest the point (-10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0, -10.0) as another candidate for the global maximum due to its extremity in the negative direction, which may yield surprising high values in certain functions.",
