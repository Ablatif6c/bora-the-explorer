    "rationale": "Given the bound constraints, exploring a point that is at the midpoint of the parameter range, such as (5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0), could reveal valuable insights. This point is strategically chosen to test the upper bounds of the space, which can often yield a high value for functions that are increasing in those regions.",
