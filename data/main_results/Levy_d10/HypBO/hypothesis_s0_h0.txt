    "rationale": "Given the symmetric nature of the parameter space and the possible patterns in mathematical functions, one common heuristic is to start the search around the center of the bounds. In this case, I suggest the point (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), which is the origin, as it is often a point of interest in many functions. I have medium confidence in this as an initial guess and feel it captures a reasonable exploratory point in the center of the defined space.",
