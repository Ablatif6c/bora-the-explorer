    "rationale": "In many cases, black-box functions exhibit local optima that can be somewhat away from the center. Therefore, as an alternative starting point, I suggest evaluating a point slightly shifted from the center towards the positive corner of the parameter space. Here, I propose the location (5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) as it balances between the center and a higher potential for finding a local/global maximum.",
