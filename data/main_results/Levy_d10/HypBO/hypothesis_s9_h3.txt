    "rationale": "Based on the nature of many mathematical functions, they can sometimes have global maxima at the corners of the defined space. Therefore, I suggest evaluating the point at the extreme negative bounds for all parameters, which is (-10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10). Such corner cases can often reveal interesting features of the function and may lead to discovering local or global maxima.",
