    "rationale": "Considering that many optimization problems tend to have their maximum at extreme or boundary values, I propose evaluating the point at the maximum bounds of all parameters, which is (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10). This point is a common candidate for maxima in various mathematical functions, especially when the function has positive correlations with input parameters.",
