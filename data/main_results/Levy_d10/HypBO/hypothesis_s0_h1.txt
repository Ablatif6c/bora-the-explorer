    "rationale": "Based on my understanding of many mathematical functions, extrema can often be located at the bounds of the search space. Given this, I suggest testing a point at the upper limit for all parameters, specifically (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10). This could be beneficial as it explores the edge of the defined space, which may also reveal peaks in the function.",
