    "rationale": "Another common strategy in optimization is to evaluate the corners of the search space, as these points can often harbor local or even global optima. Thus, I propose testing the point (-10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10, -10), which is the lower corner of the parameter bounds. This provides a contrasting evaluation compared to previous guesses and helps to cover the search space more fully.",
