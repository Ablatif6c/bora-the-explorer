    "rationale": "Considering the symmetrical nature and the specified bounds of the parameters, a central point such as (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) is a reasonable first guess. It is a common strategy in multi-dimensional optimization to start from the center of the feasible space, as this often lies within the region where many functions achieve significant values, especially if the function is well-behaved.",
