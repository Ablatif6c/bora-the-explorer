    "rationale": "Based on the symmetry and range of the parameters, it is common in many mathematical functions that extrema occur at the boundaries or corners of the defined space. Given the bounds are from -10 to 10 for each parameter, I hypothesize that the maximum might occur at the positive corner of the search space, as many functions tend to yield higher outputs with larger input values. Therefore, the point (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10) is likely to be optimal.",
