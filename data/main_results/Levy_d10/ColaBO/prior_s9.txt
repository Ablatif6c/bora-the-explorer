    "rationale":"In many mathematical functions, particularly well-known ones, the global maximum often occurs at one of the extreme boundaries of the defined search space. Given that the boundaries for all parameters are set between -10.0 and 10.0, a logical initial guess for a maximum point would be at the upper bounds of all the parameters, as this generally produces higher output values in polynomial and exponential functions. Therefore, I propose (10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0) as a probable location for the global maximum.",
