    "rationale":"Given the symmetric nature of the parameter space and no additional information about the black-box function characteristics, it's reasonable to conjecture that the global maximum might be located at one of the extreme points. Since the bounds for all parameters are from -10.0 to 10.0, choosing the upper bound for all parameters suggests a high potential for maximizing the target function.",
