    "rationale":"In multivariate functions, it is common for the global maximum to occur at points near the boundaries of the defined range, especially when the function has no known symmetries or specific patterns leading to a peak near the center. Given the uniform bounds of (-10.0, 10.0) for all variables, selecting a point at the extreme is a reasonable initial guess. The corner point (10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0) is a candidate for exploring potential maxima due to its position at the outer limit of the domain.",
