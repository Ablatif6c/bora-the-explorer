    "rationale":"The function to be optimized is a mathematical black-box function with no specific identifying features. A reasonable approach is to start with the midpoint of the search space. This is often a common practice as it provides a balanced starting point that is likely to capture the global maximum in symmetric, continuous functions. Thus, the average of the bounds for each parameter, which is (0.0), is chosen as the initial guess.",
