    "rationale":"Given that the parameter space is symmetric and bounded between -10.0 and 10.0, it is common for mathematical functions to have extreme values at the boundaries. A logical guess for maximizing the output is to test the upper bound of the search space, particularly where all parameters are equal, as many functions exhibit tendencies towards such symmetric configurations.",
