    "rationale":"Based on the bounds provided for each parameter, the global maximum of the function is likely to be found at the extreme values of the defined range. Since the function is a mathematical black-box, many such functions have local maxima at the boundaries of the input space. Therefore, I am guessing that the maximum is at the corner of the search space, which is (10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0).",
