    "rationale":"The search space for each parameter is symmetric and centered around zero. Since the function is black-box and not explicitly defined, a reasonable starting guess for the global maximum in many mathematical functions is often at the center of the bounds, which is (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). This assumption is based on the idea that many functions achieve their highest values around the mean value of the bounds, especially when the function is smooth and continuous.",
