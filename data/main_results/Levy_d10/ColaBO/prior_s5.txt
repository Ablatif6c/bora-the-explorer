    "rationale":"Based on the properties of many mathematical functions, particularly those with multiple input variables, extrema often occur near the bounds of the search space. Given the symmetrical bounds from -10.0 to 10.0 for each parameter, a location near the positive boundary could represent a potential maximum. Therefore, an initial guess at the point (10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10) is chosen, assuming the function may exhibit some form of increasing trend towards the limits.",
