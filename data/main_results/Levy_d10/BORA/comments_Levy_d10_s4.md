## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on ten input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) through \(x_9\), each constrained within the bounds of \([-10.0, 10.0]\). These parameters will guide the exploration of the function's landscape, allowing us to systematically assess how variations in their values influence the target outcome.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to efficiently navigate the high-dimensional parameter space. By utilizing a probabilistic model, BO will iteratively suggest new points to evaluate based on previous observations, balancing exploration of untested areas with exploitation of known high-performing regions. This approach is particularly advantageous in black-box scenarios where function evaluations are costly or time-consuming.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance and suggest additional points for evaluation when the BO process plateaus, indicating a potential local maximum. By identifying conditions that yield the highest target values, we aim to converge on the optimal parameter settings, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the underlying function and its behavior across the defined input space.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses generated focus on different combinations of parameter values that may reveal interesting behaviors and relationships. By strategically selecting points across the entire range, we can better understand the function's landscape and identify promising areas for further exploration. The hypotheses include testing both extremes and midpoints, which may uncover non-linearities and interactions between parameters that influence the target. This balanced approach will help us identify potential maxima and guide subsequent iterations of Bayesian Optimization effectively.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### Positive Extremes

*Rationale:* Exploring the upper bounds of the parameter space may reveal high target values due to potential non-linearities in the function.

## Iteration 13

As we progress through iteration 12 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest target value observed is 805.347 at the point (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), indicating that the central region of the parameter space is particularly promising. Conversely, the point (10.0, -10.0, 10.0, -10.0, 10.0, -10.0, 10.0, -10.0, 10.0, -10.0) yielded a significantly lower target of 205.176, suggesting that extreme combinations of parameters are detrimental. The subspace around (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0) appears to maximize the target, while the extremes and alternating extremes hypothesis have proven to be less effective. Additionally, points with slight perturbations around the center, such as (1.821, 5.907, 4.749, -1.550, -4.117, -5.436, -2.091, 0.311, -6.853, 4.964) and (0.570, 3.160, 0.462, 0.152, -0.662, -0.694, -3.024, 2.978, 1.288, 2.444), have also shown promising results. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to focus on the central region and explore slight perturbations around it, while discarding those that have consistently underperformed.

### Updated Hypotheses

*Confidence:* low

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 1.2, 'x_1': -0.3, 'x_2': 0.8, 'x_3': 0.1, 'x_4': -0.5, 'x_5': 0.4, 'x_6': 0.2, 'x_7': -0.1, 'x_8': 0.3, 'x_9': 0.0}

## Iteration 23

In this iteration, we are focusing on exploring the extreme regions of the parameter space as suggested by the Bayesian Optimizer. The previous iterations have indicated that while the central region has yielded high target values, the maximum observed target value is 806.021 at the point (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5). This suggests that slight perturbations around the center are particularly promising. However, it is also essential to investigate how the function behaves at the boundaries. The hypotheses generated for this iteration include points that push the limits of the parameter space, which may reveal unexpected interactions or maxima. By testing these extreme points, such as (-10.000, 10.000, -0.840, -1.326, 10.000, -10.000, -10.000, 10.000, 10.000, 10.000) and (10.000, 1.651, -10.000, 10.000, -10.000, 10.000, 10.000, -10.000, -10.000, -10.000), we aim to gather more data that could inform our understanding of the function's overall landscape and potentially uncover new high-performing regions.

This suggests that slight perturbations around the center are particularly promising. However, it is also essential to investigate points that may push the boundaries of the parameter space or explore new combinations that could lead to higher target values. The hypotheses generated for this iteration include points that represent a mix of moderate and extreme values, which may reveal beneficial interactions or maxima. By testing these new points, we aim to gather more data that could inform our understanding of the function's overall landscape and potentially uncover new high-performing regions. The selected hypotheses include a moderate exploration point and an extreme positive combination, which may provide insights into the function's behavior in both central and boundary regions.

This suggests that slight perturbations around the center are particularly promising. However, we also need to explore points that push the boundaries of the parameter space and investigate combinations that could lead to higher target values. The suggested points from the optimizer include combinations of extreme and moderate values, which may reveal beneficial interactions or maxima. By testing these new points, such as (10.000, 10.000, -4.727, -2.551, 10.000, 0.909, 2.355, -0.779, -5.540, 10.000) and (8.543, 9.269, -6.977, -2.540, 9.469, 0.883, 1.244, -1.710, -5.402, 9.396), we aim to gather more data that could inform our understanding of the function's overall landscape and potentially uncover new high-performing regions.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring diverse regions of the parameter space, including extremes and midpoints. However, as the iterations progressed, it became evident that the central region of the parameter space yielded the highest target values, with the maximum observed target being 806.021 at the point (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5).

This finding prompted a shift in strategy, leading to a concentrated exploration of slight perturbations around the center. Hypotheses were refined to focus on variations near this optimal point, while extreme combinations that consistently underperformed were deprioritized. The emphasis on central exploration allowed for a better understanding of the function's behavior, revealing beneficial interactions that enhanced the target.

As the optimization progressed, confidence in hypotheses related to central exploration increased, while those exploring extremes saw a decline in confidence. This iterative learning process underscored the importance of adapting hypotheses based on empirical results.
