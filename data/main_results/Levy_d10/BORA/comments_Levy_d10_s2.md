## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on ten input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) through \(x_9\), each constrained within the bounds of (-10.0, 10.0). These parameters will guide the exploration of the function's landscape, allowing us to systematically assess how variations in their values influence the target outcome.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to efficiently navigate the parameter space by constructing a probabilistic model of the function. This model will help predict the function's behavior and identify promising regions for exploration. As the optimization progresses, BO will iteratively suggest new points to evaluate based on the expected improvement over the current best-known results.

In the event that the optimization process plateaus—indicating diminishing returns from further evaluations—strategic point suggestions will be made to explore unexplored areas or refine the search around promising regions. The intended outcome is to converge on parameter settings that yield the highest function value, thereby maximizing the target effectively while minimizing the number of evaluations needed. This approach leverages the strengths of BO in balancing exploration and exploitation within the defined constraints.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses generated are based on expected behaviors and relationships among parameters, considering both extremes and midpoints within the defined bounds. By sampling at the lower and upper extremes, as well as the midpoint, we can assess how the function behaves across the entire range. Additionally, exploring a balanced mix of positive and negative values may reveal interactions between parameters that influence the target outcome. Finally, incorporating a random point allows us to investigate potentially overlooked areas of the parameter space, which could yield unexpected results. This comprehensive approach will help us identify promising areas for further exploration and refine our understanding of the function's landscape, ultimately guiding us toward maximizing the target effectively.

## Iteration 13

As we progress through iteration 12 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest target value observed is 805.347 at the midpoint (0,0,...,0), indicating that the function has a significant peak around this region. The second-highest value of 788.675 was recorded at (-1.440, -1.119, -1.038, -1.083, 0.474, -1.011, -2.368, 0.634, 2.146, -3.159), suggesting that there are promising subspaces in the negative regions of the parameter space, particularly around mid-negative values. Conversely, the extreme positive values (10,10,...,10) yielded a lower target of 315.640, indicating that this subspace is less favorable. The data suggests that the function is sensitive to the balance of positive and negative values, with certain combinations yielding higher outputs. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to focus on the promising regions identified, while discarding those that have consistently underperformed. New hypotheses will explore variations around the high-performing points and the negative regions that showed potential, particularly around the midpoint and the promising negative regions.

## Iteration 24

In this iteration, we are focusing on two new hypotheses based on the latest suggestions from the Bayesian Optimizer. The highest target value observed so far is 806.790, achieved at the point (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0). This indicates that the function has a significant peak around slightly positive values. Additionally, the second-highest value of 806.021 was recorded at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), suggesting that there are promising subspaces in the vicinity of the midpoint. The suggested points from the optimizer are concentrated around negative values for (x_0) and (x_1), while (x_2) is fixed at its upper bound of 10. This combination may reveal interactions that could lead to higher target values, especially given the previous observations of the function's sensitivity to parameter balance. The hypotheses aim to explore this promising region further, leveraging the optimizer's recommendations to maximize the target effectively.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring diverse regions of the parameter space, including extreme negative and positive values, midpoints, and random points. This approach aimed to gather a broad understanding of the function's behavior.

As the iterations progressed, the highest target values were consistently observed around slightly positive values, particularly at (1.0, 1.0, ..., 1.0) and (0.5, 0.5, ..., 0.5). This led to a shift in focus towards refining hypotheses around these high-performing points. The exploration of negative regions was also emphasized, particularly around mid-negative values, which showed potential for beneficial interactions among parameters.

The hypotheses became more targeted, concentrating on slight variations around known high-performing points and exploring combinations of positive and negative values that could yield higher outputs. The confidence in hypotheses was adjusted based on their performance, with higher confidence assigned to those that consistently yielded better results.

The following table summarizes the evolution of confidence in the hypotheses throughout the optimization:
