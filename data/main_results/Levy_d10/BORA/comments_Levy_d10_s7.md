## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on ten input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) through \(x_9\), each constrained within the bounds of (-10.0, 10.0). These parameters will be systematically explored to uncover their influence on the target function.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to efficiently navigate the high-dimensional parameter space. By utilizing a probabilistic model, BO will iteratively suggest new points to evaluate based on previous observations, balancing exploration of untested areas and exploitation of known high-performing regions. This approach is particularly advantageous in black-box scenarios where function evaluations are costly or time-consuming.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance of the function and provide suggestions for new points to evaluate, especially when the optimization appears to plateau. This will involve identifying conditions or regions in the parameter space that show promise for maximizing the target. The intended outcome is to converge on the optimal parameter settings that yield the highest function value, thereby enhancing our understanding of the underlying function's behavior.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses generated focus on different combinations of parameter values that may reveal interesting behaviors or relationships. By strategically selecting points, we can enhance our understanding of the function's landscape and identify promising areas for further exploration. The hypotheses include exploring extreme values, both negative and positive, to uncover potential local maxima, as well as sampling the center of the parameter space to establish a baseline performance. Additionally, a diagonal exploration is proposed to identify trends or patterns in the function's behavior. This comprehensive approach will allow us to effectively map the function's characteristics and identify conditions that maximize the target.

## Iteration 13

As we progress through iteration 12 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest target value observed is 805.347 at the center of the parameter space (0,0,...,0), indicating a significant peak around this region. The second highest value of 765.228 was recorded at a point with mixed negative and positive values (-4.666, -4.367, -0.965, -1.947, -0.089, 4.610, -2.589, -2.294, -2.464, -0.752), suggesting beneficial interactions between parameters. Conversely, the extreme negative and positive values (e.g., -9.5 and 9.5) yielded lower target values (315.379 and 365.578, respectively), indicating that these regions are likely detrimental. The data suggests that the subspaces around the center and mixed values are promising, while extreme values are less favorable. Moving forward, I will refine the previous hypotheses, focusing on the identified promising regions and discarding those that consistently performed poorly.

## Iteration 24

In this iteration, we are focusing on two new hypotheses based on the latest suggestions from the Bayesian Optimizer. The highest target value observed so far is 806.021 at the point (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), indicating a significant peak around the center of the parameter space. Additionally, a strong target value of 765.228 was recorded at a point with mixed negative and positive values (-4.666, -4.367, -0.965, -1.947, -0.089, 4.610, -2.589, -2.294, -2.464, -0.752), suggesting beneficial interactions among parameters. The recent suggestions from the optimizer focus on slightly negative values for (x_0) and positive values for (x_1) and (x_4), which may reveal further beneficial interactions. The first hypothesis explores a combination of these values, while the second hypothesis tests a similar point with a slight variation in the last parameter, aiming to capture any nuances in the function's behavior. These hypotheses will help us refine our understanding of the parameter space and potentially lead to higher target values.

## Iteration 82

As we reach iteration 81 of the Bayesian Optimization, the data reveals significant insights into the behavior of the target function. The highest target value observed is 806.790 at the point (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), indicating a strong peak around the center of the parameter space. The subspaces around the center (0.5 to 1.0) consistently yield high target values, with the second highest value of 806.742 also found at (0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9). Additionally, mixed values such as (-4.666, -4.367, -0.965, -1.947, -0.089, 4.610, -2.589, -2.294, -2.464, -0.752) show promise with a target of 765.228. Conversely, extreme values, particularly those near -10 and 10, consistently yield lower target values, indicating these regions are detrimental. Moving forward, I will refine the hypotheses to focus on the promising subspaces around the center and mixed values while discarding those that have not performed well. The next hypotheses will include further exploration around the center, combinations of slightly negative and positive values, and slight variations in previously successful points to maximize the target effectively.

## Iteration 91

In this iteration, we are focusing on two new hypotheses based on the latest suggestions from the Bayesian Optimizer. The highest target value observed so far is 806.790 at the point (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), indicating a strong peak around the center of the parameter space. Additionally, the mixed values around (-4.666, -4.367, -0.965, -1.947, -0.089, 4.610, -2.589, -2.294, -2.464, -0.752) continue to show promise with a target of 765.228. The first hypothesis explores the extreme values of the parameter space, specifically the point (-10.000, 10.000, 10.000, -10.000, 10.000, -10.000, 10.000, 10.000, -10.000, -10.000). While previous iterations indicated that extreme values generally yield lower target values, it is essential to explore these regions to confirm their behavior. The second hypothesis examines a point with slightly varied parameters (2.712, 10.000, 10.000, -10.000, 10.000, -10.000, 0.016, -2.171, -10.000, -10.000), which may uncover beneficial interactions among parameters. This approach aims to maximize the target by systematically exploring both extreme and varied parameter settings.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Exploration of Extreme Values

*Rationale:* This hypothesis tests the extreme values of the parameter space to confirm their behavior and potential interactions.

*Confidence:* low

#### Exploration of Varied Parameters

*Rationale:* This hypothesis explores a point with slightly varied parameters, which may reveal beneficial interactions and higher target values.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 2.712, 'x_1': 10.0, 'x_2': 10.0, 'x_3': -10.0, 'x_4': 10.0, 'x_5': -10.0, 'x_6': 0.016, 'x_7': -2.171, 'x_8': -10.0, 'x_9': -10.0}

## Iteration 101

In this iteration, we are focusing on two new hypotheses based on the latest suggestions from the Bayesian Optimizer. The highest target value observed so far is 806.790 at the point (1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0), indicating a strong peak around the center of the parameter space. Additionally, the mixed values around (-4.666, -4.367, -0.965, -1.947, -0.089, 4.610, -2.589, -2.294, -2.464, -0.752) continue to show promise with a target of 765.228. The first hypothesis explores a point with slightly positive values and a mix of negative values, which may reveal beneficial interactions among parameters. The second hypothesis tests extreme values of the parameter space, specifically a point with extreme positive and negative values. While previous iterations indicated that extreme values generally yield lower target values, it is essential to explore these regions to confirm their behavior. This approach aims to maximize the target by systematically exploring both promising and extreme parameter settings.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring extreme values and the center of the parameter space. However, as we gathered data, it became clear that the center (0,0,...,0) consistently yielded high target values, peaking at 806.790. This prompted a shift towards refining hypotheses around this central region, with slight variations to capture any nuances in the function's behavior.

The exploration of mixed values, which combined slightly negative and positive parameters, also emerged as a promising area. The data indicated beneficial interactions among parameters in these mixed regions, leading to hypotheses that focused on combinations of these values. Conversely, extreme values were shown to be detrimental, leading to a decrease in confidence for hypotheses centered around them.

As the iterations progressed, the confidence in hypotheses that explored the center and mixed values increased, while those targeting extreme values saw a decline. This adaptive approach allowed for a more targeted exploration of the parameter space, ultimately leading to the identification of optimal settings.
