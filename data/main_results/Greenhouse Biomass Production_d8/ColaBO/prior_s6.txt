    "rationale":"To maximize biomass production of sugar beet in a greenhouse, optimal conditions typically include high irradiance for photosynthesis, moderate temperatures to avoid heat stress, adequate moisture levels, and low wind speed to minimize water loss. Given the range of parameters, I suggest maximum irradiance (8000 kJ/m2/day), moderate temperatures (tmin at 10°C and tmax at 25°C), a high but realistic vapour pressure of 2 kPA, low wind speed of 1 m/s, negligible rainfall (1 mm) to control soil moisture, maximum wav of 100 cm for optimal irrigation, and a SMLIM of 0.9 which indicates high moisture retention capacity.",
