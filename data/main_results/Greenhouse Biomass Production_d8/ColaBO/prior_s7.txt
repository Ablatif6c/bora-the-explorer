    "rationale": "In greenhouse cultivation, plants generally thrive under optimal weather conditions. For sugar beet, maximizing biomass production would require high irradiance for photosynthesis, warm temperatures to promote growth, adequate vapor pressure to optimize transpiration, and sufficient soil moisture without over-saturation. Based on typical successful growing conditions, I suggest high irradiance and moderately high temperatures within the provided bounds but without extremes. Thus, I propose: high irradiance (around 7000 kJ/m2/day), minimum temperature at a warm level (15°C), maximum temperature at a supportive level for growth (25°C), a strong vapor pressure (4 kPA), minimal wind speed (1.5 m/s to minimize drying), low rainfall (5 mm for stability), ample initial water (80 cm), and a maximum moisture content (0.8) to ensure optimal growth conditions while preventing water deficiency.",
