    "rationale": "To maximize biomass production of sugar beet, high irradiance and optimal temperature ranges are critical. A daily minimum temperature around 15°C and a maximum around 25°C is generally conducive to plant growth. Additionally, a moderate vapour pressure and sufficient initial moisture content are important. A wind speed below 2 m/s minimizes stress on the plants. Considering these factors, I estimate the global maximum at irradiance levels that support photosynthesis without exceeding the plant's tolerance, hence a maximum of 7000 kJ/m2/day is chosen, along with moderate and sustainable values for other parameters.",
