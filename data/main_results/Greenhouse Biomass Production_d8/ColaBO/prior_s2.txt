    "rationale":"In greenhouse conditions, optimal biomass production of sugar beet would likely require a balance of adequate irradiance, appropriate temperature ranges, and sufficient moisture. High irradiance levels promote photosynthesis, while a minimum temperature of around 10°C and a maximum of about 30°C are ideal for sugar beet growth. Moderate vapor pressure, low wind speed, and a controlled amount of rainfall can help maintain humidity without waterlogging. Additionally, a moisture-rich soil profile supports root growth. Therefore, I propose a high irradiance value, moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture settings to maximize biomass production.",
