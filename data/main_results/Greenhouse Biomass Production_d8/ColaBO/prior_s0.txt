    "rationale":"To maximize biomass production of sugar beet in a greenhouse, optimal conditions would likely include high irradiance levels to promote photosynthesis, moderate temperatures to avoid stress, sufficient vapor pressure for transpiration, low wind speed to prevent moisture loss, controlled rainfall for water supply, adequate soil moisture, and optimal initial moisture content in the rooting zone. Based on common agricultural best practices, I propose high irradiance with temperatures that balance warmth and moisture retention. The suggested values aim to maximize biomass efficiently in controlled environments.",
