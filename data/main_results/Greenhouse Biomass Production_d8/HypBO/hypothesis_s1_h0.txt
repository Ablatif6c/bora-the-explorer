    "name": "Optimal Greenhouse Conditions for Sugar Beet",
    "rationale": "In a greenhouse setting, maximizing biomass production of sugar beet generally requires optimal irradiance, temperature, and moisture levels. Given that sugar beets thrive in warm, sunny conditions with adequate water, I suggest high irradiance, moderate temperatures, and sufficient moisture in the soil. Based on general agricultural knowledge, I propose a configuration with high irradiance and optimal temperature ranges while ensuring enough water content.",
