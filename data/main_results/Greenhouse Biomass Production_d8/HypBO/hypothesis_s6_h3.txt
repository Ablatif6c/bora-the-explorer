    "name": "Optimal Growth Strategy for Sugar Beet",
    "rationale": "For maximizing biomass production, high irradiance is crucial for enhancing photosynthesis, so the maximum value is recommended. A tmin of 22°C and a tmax of 32°C fall within an optimal growth temperature range for sugar beet, encouraging robust growth. A vapour pressure of around 4 kPA provides necessary moisture balance without inducing stress. Favorable conditions with low wind speed and sufficient rainfall, along with high water availability in the soil profile and maximum moisture retention capacity, will contribute positively to plant health and biomass yield.",
