    "name": "Optimal Conditions for Sugar Beet",
    "rationale": "To maximize biomass production of sugar beet in a greenhouse, it's essential to provide adequate irradiance for photosynthesis, optimal temperature for growth, and appropriate moisture levels. High irradiance (around 7000 kJ/m2/day) supports strong photosynthetic activity. A daily minimum temperature of about 15°C ensures healthy growth, while a maximum of 25°C avoids heat stress. Vapor pressure around 2 kPa allows for effective transpiration, and a wind speed of 1 m/s helps with cooling without stressing the plants. Rainfall should be minimal but sufficient to maintain soil moisture, setting it to 5 mm. The initial water in the soil profile should be around 70 cm, paired with a maximum moisture content in the rooting zone of 0.8, providing a conducive environment for growth.",
