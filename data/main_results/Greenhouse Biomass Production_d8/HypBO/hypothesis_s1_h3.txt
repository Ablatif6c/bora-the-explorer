    "rationale": "To maximize biomass production in a greenhouse, it's critical to mimic the ideal outdoor conditions for sugar beets. This configuration suggests high irradiance and optimal temperature ranges, complemented by sufficient moisture and low wind speeds to reduce stress on the plants. The values proposed are designed to create a stress-free environment, protecting the plantsâ€™ growth potential while facilitating optimal nutrient and water uptake.",
