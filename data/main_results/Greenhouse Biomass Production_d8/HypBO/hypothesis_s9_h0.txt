    "rationale": "To maximize biomass production in a greenhouse environment, it's important to simulate ideal growing conditions. High irradiance is crucial for photosynthesis, while optimal temperature and humidity levels facilitate growth. A balance of moisture from rainfall and soil water is also essential to avoid stress on plants. Thus, I suggest higher bounds for irradiance, temperature, and moderate levels for other parameters to create an environment conducive to biomass production.",
