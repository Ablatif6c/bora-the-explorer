    "rationale": "To achieve optimal biomass production, maximum irradiance supports photosynthesis significantly. Setting tmin and tmax at 18°C and 28°C respectively promotes ideal growth temperatures. A daily mean vapour pressure of around 3 kPA provides necessary moisture without causing excess stress. The wind speed should be maintained low to avoid water loss, while adequate rainfall coupled with a high initial moisture content in the soil profile ensures that the plants have sufficient water to thrive throughout the month.",
