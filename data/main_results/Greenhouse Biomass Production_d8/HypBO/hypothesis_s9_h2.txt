    "name": "Highly Optimized Growth Parameters for Sugar Beet",
    "rationale": "For maximizing sugar beet biomass production, it is essential to ensure very high light exposure paired with temperatures that encourage growth without inducing heat stress. A strong vapor pressure maintains adequate humidity levels, while moderate wind speeds reduce potential water loss but still allow for air circulation. Adequate rainfall combined with high initial soil water content supports optimal moisture availability.",
