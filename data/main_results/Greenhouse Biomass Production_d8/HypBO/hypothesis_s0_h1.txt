    "rationale": "For optimal sugar beet growth in a greenhouse setup, a balanced combination of parameters is crucial. A high irradiance value of 7500 kJ/m2/day will provide ample energy for photosynthesis. Setting the daily minimum temperature at 15°C and maximum temperature at 30°C creates a warm environment that is beneficial for growth without inducing heat stress. A vapor pressure of 4 kPa is ideal for maintaining humidity levels that facilitate healthy plant respiration. A wind speed of 0.5 m/s helps to avoid excessive deformation of the plants while ensuring air circulation. Minimal rainfall (2 mm) will maintain soil moisture without saturation. Starting with a water content of 90 cm supports water availability, and a maximum soil moisture content of 0.9 ensures that moisture is retained efficiently throughout the growth period.",
