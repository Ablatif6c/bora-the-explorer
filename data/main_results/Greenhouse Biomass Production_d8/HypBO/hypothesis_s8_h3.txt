    "name": "Ideal Growth Conditions for Sugar Beet",
    "rationale": "To enhance biomass production of sugar beet significantly, ideal growth conditions must be established. Setting irradiance at around 7400 kJ/m2/day maximizes photosynthetic efficiency. A daily minimum temperature of 14°C and a maximum temperature of 24°C create an ideal thermal environment, promoting growth without causing stress. A vapor pressure of 1.8 kPa maintains sufficient moisture for transpiration while avoiding saturation. A wind speed of approximately 1 m/s encourages air circulation without excessive drying. Limiting rainfall to 4 mm ensures that the soil remains adequately moist but not waterlogged, and initializing the water in the soil profile at 90 cm, along with a maximum moisture content of 0.9, provides ample hydration for robust root development.",
