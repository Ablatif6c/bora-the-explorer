    "name": "Optimal Environmental Conditions for Sugar Beet",
    "rationale": "Maximizing sugar beet biomass requires a well-balanced environment, focusing on light, temperature, and moisture. An irradiance level of 7700 kJ/m2/day is proposed, ensuring strong photosynthesis. For temperatures, tmin should be set at 14°C and tmax at 26°C, promoting growth while avoiding heat stress. A vapor pressure of 0.7 kPA provides adequate humidity without excess, while a wind speed of 2 m/s aids in air circulation without causing damage to the plants. Rainfall should be moderate at 4 mm to maintain moisture levels in the soil. An initial soil water content of 55 cm balances hydration, while a SMLIM of 0.75 allows for effective water retention in the rooting zone.",
