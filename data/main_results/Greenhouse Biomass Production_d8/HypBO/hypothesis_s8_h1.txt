    "rationale": "For optimal sugar beet biomass production, the conditions should reflect a balance of sunlight, temperature, moisture, and air circulation. A high irradiance of 7500 kJ/m2/day will maximize photosynthesis, crucial for biomass accumulation. Setting the daily minimum temperature at 10°C and a maximum at 20°C creates a favorable thermal environment, minimizing stress and promoting growth. A vapor pressure of 1.5 kPa ensures that transpiration rates are suitable for nutrient uptake. A wind speed of 2 m/s is moderate enough to promote gas exchange without causing water loss. Rainfall capped at 10 mm is beneficial for soil moisture retention, while initializing the water level in the soil profile at 60 cm alongside a maximum soil moisture content of 0.7 creates an optimal hydration state for root development.",
