    "rationale": "To achieve high biomass production, a balance of strong light and moderate temperature helps create an optimal growth environment. Adequate moisture from both subsoil water and rainfall supports the plants without causing excess water stress. A slightly higher vapour pressure enhances the growth conditions while maintaining a level of wind speed that avoids water loss but promotes air circulation, essential for photosynthesis.",
