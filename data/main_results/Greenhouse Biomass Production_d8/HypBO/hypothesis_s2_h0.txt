    "name": "Optimal Sugar Beet Growth Conditions",
    "rationale": "To maximize biomass production of sugar beet, optimal conditions such as high irradiance and appropriate temperature are crucial. Irradiance around the maximum value (8000 kJ/m2/day) ensures the plants receive ample light for photosynthesis. Temperatures should be warm but not extreme; setting tmin at 10°C and tmax at 30°C creates a favorable growth environment while avoiding heat stress. Daily mean vapor pressure around 1 kPA balances moisture without excessive humidity, while a wind speed of 1 m/s helps with air circulation. Rainfall should be moderate at around 5 mm to support soil moisture, complemented by 50 cm of initial water in the soil profile and optimal SMLIM at 0.8 to retain moisture effectively.",
