    "name": "Ideal Conditions for Sugar Beet Biomass Maximization",
    "rationale": "To achieve maximum biomass production for sugar beet in a greenhouse, a careful selection of parameters is vital. Setting irradiance at 6800 kJ/m2/day provides robust light for photosynthesis while avoiding light saturation. An optimal temperature range with a minimum at 14°C and maximum at 26°C balances warmth and prevents heat stress. A vapor pressure of 5 kPa is ideal for maintaining humidity without excessive moisture. A wind speed of 0.7 m/s enhances air circulation around the plants without causing damage. Rainfall should be kept low at 4 mm to maintain slight tension in the soil. An initial water amount of 75 cm promotes sufficient moisture levels, and a maximum initial moisture content of 0.85 supports water retention, ensuring the root zone remains adequately moist throughout the growth period.",
