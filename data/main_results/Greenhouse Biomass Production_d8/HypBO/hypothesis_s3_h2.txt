    "name": "Ideal Conditions for Maximizing Sugar Beet Biomass",
    "rationale": "To achieve maximum biomass production in sugar beet, a strategy that combines high light availability with optimal temperature and humidity levels is essential. High irradiance enhances photosynthesis, while moderate temperatures prevent thermal stress. A balanced water supply and limited wind conditions will further support healthy growth and development. This combination reflects an environment conducive to robust biomass accumulation.",
