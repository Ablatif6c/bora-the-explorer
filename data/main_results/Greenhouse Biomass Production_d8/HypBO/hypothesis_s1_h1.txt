    "rationale": "To achieve maximum biomass production for sugar beet, it is essential to balance both temperature and moisture while ensuring enough sunlight. This configuration proposes slightly lower irradiance to maintain the integrity of temperature and saturation. The temperature window provides a warm environment, while adequate vapour pressure and initial water content facilitate optimal growth and nutrient uptake.",
