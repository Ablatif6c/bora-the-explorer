# Greenhouse Biomass Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment, specifically targeting the Total Above Ground Production (TAGP). The initial biomass is set at 0.41 kg/ha, and the experiment will systematically manipulate several environmental parameters to identify optimal conditions for growth.

The optimization parameters include irradiance (irrad), daily minimum and maximum temperatures (tmin, tmax), daily mean vapor pressure (vap), wind speed (wind), daily rainfall (rain), initial water content in the soil profile (wav), and maximum moisture content in the rooting depth zone (SMLIM). Each parameter has defined bounds, ensuring that the experimental conditions remain realistic and feasible.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to explore the parameter space efficiently. BO will utilize a probabilistic model to predict TAGP based on the current parameter settings, iteratively refining its search based on observed outcomes. When the optimization process plateaus, I will suggest new points to explore, focusing on regions of the parameter space that show promise for maximizing TAGP. This adaptive approach will help identify the optimal conditions for sugar beet biomass production, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity in controlled environments.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse hypotheses that capture different aspects of the parameter space for maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) of sugar beet. The selected points are designed to cover a range of environmental conditions, considering the interplay between light, temperature, moisture, and other factors that influence biomass production. Each hypothesis reflects a unique combination of parameters that could potentially optimize growth. For instance, moderate irradiance and temperature are expected to enhance photosynthesis while minimizing plant stress. Conversely, high irradiance with optimal moisture may significantly boost growth rates, provided temperatures remain within a suitable range. Additionally, cooler temperatures with higher humidity could reduce stress and promote biomass accumulation, especially in early growth stages. A balanced approach with moderate values across all parameters may provide a stable environment for optimal growth. Lastly, higher temperatures with low wind speeds could create a warm microclimate conducive to growth, assuming sufficient moisture is available. These hypotheses will provide a foundation for the Bayesian Optimization process, allowing us to identify promising regions for further exploration.

## Iteration 34

As we progress through iteration 33 of the Bayesian Optimization, we observe that several parameter combinations have yielded promising results for maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP). The highest TAGP recorded is 9.99 kg/ha, achieved with a combination of high irradiance, moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture levels. Notably, conditions with high irradiance (around 7415-7430 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (around 12-20°C) appear to be beneficial. Conversely, extreme low temperatures (below 0°C) and high wind speeds have consistently resulted in lower TAGP, indicating that these conditions are detrimental to biomass production. The data suggests that maintaining a balance between moisture and temperature, while ensuring adequate light, is crucial for optimizing growth. The successful parameter combinations indicate that high irradiance, moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture levels are key factors in maximizing TAGP. Based on these insights, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly, and propose new ones that align with the observed successful parameter combinations.

## Iteration 48

As we reach iteration 47 of the Bayesian Optimization, the data reveals several key insights into the conditions that maximize Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) for sugar beet. The highest TAGP recorded is 9.99 kg/ha, achieved with high irradiance (around 7419.62 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (13.67-18.86°C). This suggests that maximizing light exposure while maintaining a comfortable temperature range is crucial for biomass production. Additionally, optimal moisture levels appear to play a significant role, as evidenced by the consistent performance of points with higher water availability. Conversely, conditions with extreme low temperatures (below 0°C), high wind speeds, and insufficient moisture have resulted in significantly lower TAGP, indicating these are detrimental to growth. The subspaces that maximize TAGP are characterized by high irradiance (around 7415-7430 kJ/m2/day), moderate temperatures (15-25°C), and adequate moisture levels (wav around 80-90 cm). In contrast, subspaces that minimize TAGP often involve low temperatures and high wind. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that have consistently underperformed and proposing new ones that align with the successful parameter combinations observed.

## Iteration 90

As we reach iteration 89 of the Bayesian Optimization, the data reveals significant insights into the conditions that maximize Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) for sugar beet. The highest TAGP recorded is 10.37 kg/ha, achieved under conditions of high irradiance (around 7949.78 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (around 11.60-20.19°C).

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses were broad, focusing on a diverse range of parameter combinations to explore the effects of irradiance, temperature, moisture, and other environmental factors on Total Above Ground Production (TAGP). 

As the experiments progressed, it became clear that high irradiance and moderate temperatures were consistently associated with higher TAGP values. This led to a refinement of the hypotheses, emphasizing combinations that maintained these conditions while optimizing moisture levels. The data revealed that extreme low temperatures and high wind speeds were detrimental to biomass production, prompting the exclusion of such conditions from future hypotheses.

By iteration 90, the hypotheses were more focused, targeting specific ranges of irradiance (above 7400 kJ/m2/day), moderate temperatures (15-25°C), and adequate moisture levels (around 80-90 cm). The confidence in the hypotheses increased as they aligned more closely with the successful parameter combinations observed in the experiments.

The following table summarizes the evolution of confidence in the hypotheses throughout the optimization process:

| Hypothesis Name                                      | Initial Confidence | Final Confidence |
|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| High Irradiance and Moderate Temperature              | Medium             | High             |
| Optimal Moisture with High Irradiance                 | Medium             | High             |
| High Irradiance with Low Wind and Moderate Temperature | Medium             | Medium           |
| New Hypothesis: High Irradiance with Moderate Temperature and High Moisture | Low                | High             |
| Balanced Conditions for Growth                        | Medium             | Medium           | 

This evolution reflects a more data-driven approach, leading to increasingly targeted hypotheses that effectively maximize TAGP.
