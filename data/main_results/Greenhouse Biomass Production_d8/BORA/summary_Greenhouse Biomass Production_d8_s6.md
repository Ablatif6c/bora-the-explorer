# BORA for TAGP Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment yielded a maximum TAGP of 10.4 kg/ha. The most effective parameters identified included high irradiance (8000 kJ/m²/day) combined with moderate temperatures (6-21°C) and controlled moisture levels. Throughout the optimization, hypotheses were refined based on experimental data, leading to a deeper understanding of the interactions between environmental factors and biomass production.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal environmental parameters that maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a greenhouse setting.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses proposed various combinations of environmental parameters based on existing literature and greenhouse practices. Key hypotheses included:

1. **High Irradiance with Moderate Temperature:** This hypothesis was based on the assumption that increased light availability would enhance photosynthesis, leading to higher biomass production.
2. **Moderate Irradiance and Temperature with Low Wind:** This hypothesis suggested that lower wind speeds would help maintain moisture levels and reduce plant stress.
3. **Controlled Rainfall with High Irradiance:** This hypothesis posited that high light levels combined with controlled moisture would optimize growth conditions.
4. **Avoiding Low Temperature Extremes with High Irradiance:** This hypothesis aimed to prevent stress from extreme low temperatures while maximizing light exposure.
5. **Exploring Higher Vapour Pressure:** This hypothesis suggested that increased vapor pressure could improve moisture availability, enhancing growth.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on observed outcomes. For instance, the focus shifted towards maintaining high irradiance levels while ensuring moderate temperature ranges. The exploration of vapor pressure was also refined, as higher values were tested in conjunction with optimal moisture levels. The adjustments were driven by the need to avoid extremes that negatively impacted biomass production.

- **wav:** 50 cm
- **SMLIM:** 0.8
- **TAGP:** 10.4 kg/ha

Conversely, the worst-performing sample had extreme temperature values and low moisture levels, resulting in a TAGP of 0.41 kg/ha. This sample had parameters such as:

- **Irradiance:** 2.12 kJ/m²/day
- **tmin:** -28.6°C
- **tmax:** 42.77°C
- **vap:** 1.38 kPa
- **wind:** 3.18 m/s
- **rain:** 14.28 mm
- **wav:** 60.37 cm
- **SMLIM:** 0.47

The results align with known greenhouse phenomena, where optimal light and temperature conditions are critical for maximizing photosynthesis and growth. The findings also highlight the importance of moisture management, as excessive rainfall can lead to waterlogging, negatively impacting plant health.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments include:

1. **Exploring Different Crop Varieties:** Investigate how different sugar beet varieties respond to the identified optimal conditions, as genetic factors may influence biomass production.
2. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conduct long-term studies to assess the sustainability of the identified optimal conditions over multiple growth cycles.
3. **Microclimate Management:** Experiment with localized microclimate management techniques, such as shading or humidity control, to further optimize growth conditions.
4. **Parameter Interactions:** Explore the interactions between parameters more deeply, particularly how varying one parameter affects the others and overall biomass production.
5. **Advanced Monitoring Techniques:** Implement advanced monitoring techniques, such as remote sensing or IoT devices, to gather real-time data on environmental conditions and plant responses.
