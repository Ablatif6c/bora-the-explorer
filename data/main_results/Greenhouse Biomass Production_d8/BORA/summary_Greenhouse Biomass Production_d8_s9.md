# BORA for TAGP Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) of sugar beet in a greenhouse environment yielded a maximum TAGP of 10.41 kg/ha. The most effective parameter settings included high irradiance levels (8000 kJ/m²/day) and moderate temperature ranges (10-22°C). Throughout the optimization, hypotheses were refined based on experimental data, leading to a focused exploration of parameter interactions that significantly influenced biomass production. The findings underscore the critical role of irradiance and temperature in optimizing greenhouse crop yields.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal environmental parameters that maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse setting.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses proposed a diverse range of parameter combinations, including:

1. **High Irradiance with Moderate Temperature:**  
   Rationale: High light levels are essential for photosynthesis, while moderate temperatures prevent plant stress.

2. **High Moisture and Temperature Balance:**  
   Rationale: Adequate moisture is crucial for nutrient uptake, and balanced temperatures can enhance growth.

3. **Low Wind and High Irradiance:**  
   Rationale: Minimizing wind stress can improve water retention and biomass accumulation.

4. **Balanced Rainfall and Temperature:**  
   Rationale: Moderate rainfall can enhance nutrient uptake without causing waterlogging.

5. **Maximized Irradiance with Controlled Moisture:**  
   Rationale: High light levels combined with optimal moisture can lead to ideal growth conditions.

These hypotheses were based on established agricultural principles and prior research indicating the importance of these parameters in crop production.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on the performance of previous iterations. The most notable changes included:

- **Irradiance:** The focus shifted towards the upper limit of irradiance (8000 kJ/m²/day), as it consistently correlated with higher TAGP values.
- **Temperature:** Moderate temperature ranges (10-22°C) were emphasized, as extreme temperatures negatively impacted biomass production.
- **Moisture Levels:** Adjustments were made to moisture parameters (wav and SMLIM) to find a balance that prevented water stress while ensuring adequate nutrient uptake.

These adjustments were guided by the observed performance of the hypotheses and the need to explore promising regions of the parameter space.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing sample was achieved with the following parameters:

- **Irradiance:** 8000 kJ/m²/day
- **tmin:** 10°C
- **tmax:** 20°C
- **vap:** 2 kPa
- **wind:** 0.5 m/s
- **rain:** 1 mm
- **wav:** 55 cm
- **SMLIM:** 0.4

This configuration resulted in a TAGP of 10.41 kg/ha, confirming the hypothesis that high irradiance and moderate temperatures are critical for maximizing biomass production.

Conversely, the worst-performing samples were characterized by low irradiance and extreme temperature variations, often yielding TAGP values around 0.41 kg/ha. These findings align with known greenhouse phenomena, where insufficient light and temperature stress can severely hinder plant growth.

The optimization outcomes highlighted the importance of maintaining high irradiance levels and moderate temperatures, which are essential for photosynthesis and overall plant health. The results also demonstrated that moisture levels must be carefully managed to avoid stress, reinforcing the need for balanced environmental conditions in greenhouse settings.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Additional Irradiance Levels:**  
   Investigate the effects of irradiance levels beyond 8000 kJ/m²/day to determine if there are diminishing returns or potential benefits at higher levels.

2. **Temperature Variability Studies:**  
   Conduct experiments that explore the impact of temperature fluctuations on biomass production, particularly during critical growth stages.

3. **Moisture Management Techniques:**  
   Implement advanced moisture management techniques, such as drip irrigation or soil moisture sensors, to optimize water usage and nutrient uptake.

4. **Nutrient Interaction Studies:**  
   Explore the interaction between environmental parameters and nutrient availability to identify optimal fertilization strategies that complement the identified conditions.

5. **Longitudinal Studies:**  
   Conduct long-term studies to assess the sustainability of the identified optimal conditions and their effects on crop yield over multiple growth cycles.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified the optimal parameters for maximizing TAGP in sugar beet cultivation within a greenhouse environment. The findings reinforced the critical role of high irradiance and moderate temperatures in enhancing biomass production. Throughout the experiment, hypotheses evolved based on experimental data, leading to a focused exploration of parameter interactions that significantly influenced outcomes.

The insights gained from this study are relevant not only for future greenhouse experiments but also for the broader understanding of plant growth dynamics under controlled conditions. The successful identification of optimal parameters provides a foundation for further research and practical applications in sustainable agriculture, ultimately contributing to improved crop yields and resource efficiency.
