# Greenhouse Biomass Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment, specifically targeting the Total Above Ground Production (TAGP). The initial biomass is set at 0.41 kg/ha, and the experiment will systematically manipulate several environmental parameters to identify optimal conditions for growth.

The optimization parameters include irradiance (irrad), daily minimum and maximum temperatures (tmin, tmax), daily mean vapor pressure (vap), wind speed (wind), daily rainfall (rain), initial water content in the soil profile (wav), and maximum moisture content in the rooting depth zone (SMLIM). Each parameter has defined bounds, ensuring that the experimental conditions remain realistic and feasible.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to explore the parameter space efficiently. BO will utilize a probabilistic model to predict TAGP based on the current parameter settings, iteratively refining its search based on observed outcomes. When the optimization process plateaus, I will suggest new points to explore, focusing on regions of the parameter space that show potential for higher TAGP. This adaptive approach will help identify the optimal conditions for maximizing biomass production, ultimately contributing to more efficient agricultural practices in controlled environments.

## Initial Thoughts

The initial sampling step has yielded a diverse set of hypotheses aimed at maximizing TAGP in the greenhouse. Each hypothesis considers critical parameter interactions and expected behaviors based on established agricultural practices. The selected points span a range of conditions, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space. Notably, the hypotheses emphasize the importance of irradiance, temperature, and moisture levels, which are crucial for optimal biomass production. The maximum irradiance is set at 8000 kJ/m2/day, which is at the upper limit of the defined bounds, and is expected to significantly enhance photosynthesis. Additionally, the temperature ranges proposed are within the bounds, ensuring that plants are not subjected to stress. The moisture content parameters are also carefully selected to balance water availability without causing saturation. As we proceed with Bayesian Optimization, these initial points will guide the exploration process, helping to identify promising regions for further investigation and ultimately maximizing TAGP.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### Optimal Irradiance and Moderate Temperature

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 5000, 'tmin': 15, 'tmax': 30, 'vap': 3, 'wind': 0.5, 'rain': 10, 'wav': 80, 'SMLIM': 0.8}

#### Low Wind and High Irradiance

*Rationale:* Minimizing wind can reduce transpiration stress, while high irradiance supports biomass accumulation.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 7500, 'tmin': 5, 'tmax': 20, 'vap': 1, 'wind': 0, 'rain': 2, 'wav': 30, 'SMLIM': 0.4}

#### Balanced Rainfall and Temperature

*Rationale:* A moderate amount of rainfall combined with optimal temperature ranges can enhance nutrient uptake and growth.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 6000, 'tmin': 12, 'tmax': 28, 'vap': 2.5, 'wind': 1.5, 'rain': 8, 'wav': 60, 'SMLIM': 0.6}

- {'irrad': 8000, 'tmin': 8, 'tmax': 22, 'vap': 2, 'wind': 0.2, 'rain': 1, 'wav': 40, 'SMLIM': 0.3}

## Iteration 19

As we progress through iteration 18 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest TAGP recorded is 10.41 from the parameters set at 8000 kJ/m2/day irradiance, 8°C minimum temperature, and 22°C maximum temperature, indicating that high irradiance levels are crucial for biomass production. Additionally, the second highest TAGP of 9.98 was achieved with 7500 kJ/m2/day irradiance, 5°C minimum temperature, and 20°C maximum temperature. Conversely, several experiments with low irradiance and extreme temperature ranges, such as iterations 7, 8, 9, and 12, resulted in TAGP values around 0.41, suggesting that these conditions are detrimental to growth. The data indicates that maintaining moderate temperatures (around 10-25°C) and high irradiance (above 6000 kJ/m2/day) is essential for maximizing TAGP. Furthermore, moisture levels (wav and SMLIM) should be balanced to avoid water stress. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that consistently underperformed and proposing new ones that align with the successful parameter combinations observed.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of parameter combinations, exploring various irradiance levels, temperature ranges, and moisture conditions. However, as the experiments progressed, it became clear that high irradiance (above 7000 kJ/m²/day) and moderate temperatures (around 10-25°C) were consistently associated with the highest TAGP values.

In response to the data, I refined the hypotheses to emphasize these successful conditions while varying other parameters, such as moisture levels and rainfall. This iterative approach allowed for a more targeted exploration of the parameter space, leading to the identification of optimal configurations that maximized biomass production. The hypotheses also began to incorporate insights about minimizing wind and balancing moisture levels to reduce stress on the plants.

As a result, the confidence in the hypotheses evolved, with higher confidence assigned to those that consistently yielded high TAGP values. The final hypotheses reflected a more focused strategy, concentrating on the most promising parameter combinations identified throughout the optimization process.
