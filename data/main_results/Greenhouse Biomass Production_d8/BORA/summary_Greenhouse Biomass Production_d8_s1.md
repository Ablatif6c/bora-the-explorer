# BORA for TAGP Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment yielded a maximum TAGP of 10.4 kg/ha. The most effective parameter combinations involved high irradiance levels (around 7949.78 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (11.60-20.19°C), with optimal moisture levels contributing significantly to biomass production. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data led to a focused exploration of parameter space, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the environmental conditions that favor sugar beet growth.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:** The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal environmental parameters that maximize TAGP for sugar beet in a greenhouse setting.

**Initial Hypotheses:** The initial hypotheses proposed a diverse range of parameter combinations, including:

1. **Moderate Irradiance and Temperature:** Expected to enhance photosynthesis without causing stress.
2. **High Irradiance with Optimal Moisture:** Aimed to boost growth rates through increased light exposure.
3. **Cool Temperatures with High Humidity:** Hypothesized to reduce stress and promote biomass accumulation.
4. **Balanced Conditions for Growth:** Suggested that a stable environment with moderate values across parameters would optimize growth.
5. **High Temperature and High Moisture:** Proposed that higher temperatures with sufficient moisture could enhance growth rates.

These hypotheses were grounded in existing scientific literature on plant physiology and greenhouse management.

**Key Milestones:**

| Iteration | Hypothesis Name                                      | Status         | Rationale for Change                                      |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Moderate Irradiance and Temperature                  | Confirmed      | High TAGP observed; supported by photosynthesis theory.  |
| 2         | High Irradiance with Optimal Moisture                | Confirmed      | Consistent performance; aligned with light and moisture needs. |
| 3         | Cool Temperatures with High Humidity                 | Discarded      | Poor performance; low TAGP values indicated stress.      |
| 4         | Balanced Conditions for Growth                        | Refined        | Moderate values yielded stable growth; adjusted parameters. |
| 5         | High Temperature and High Moisture                    | Discarded      | High temperatures led to stress; not optimal for growth. |

**Major Parameter Adjustments:** Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on observed TAGP outcomes. The focus shifted towards higher irradiance levels and moderate temperature ranges, as these consistently correlated with increased biomass production. The exploration of moisture levels also became critical, with adjustments made to maintain optimal soil moisture content, which was found to be essential for maximizing TAGP.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing sample was achieved with the following parameters:

- **Irradiance:** 7949.78 kJ/m2/day
- **tmin:** 11.60°C
- **tmax:** 20.19°C
- **vap:** 1.63 kPa
- **wind:** 1.92 m/s
- **rain:** 8.29 mm
- **wav:** 79.67 cm
- **SMLIM:** 0.12

This combination resulted in a TAGP of 10.4 kg/ha, demonstrating the importance of high light exposure and moderate temperatures in promoting biomass production. Conversely, the worst-performing sample, characterized by extreme low temperatures and high wind speeds, yielded a TAGP of only 0.41 kg/ha, highlighting the detrimental effects of stress conditions on plant growth.

The optimization outcomes align with known greenhouse phenomena, where light intensity and temperature are critical factors influencing photosynthesis and growth rates. The unexpected finding of high TAGP at elevated irradiance levels suggests that sugar beet may have a higher tolerance for light than previously assumed, warranting further investigation into its physiological responses.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Light Quality:** Investigate the effects of different light spectra on TAGP, as certain wavelengths may enhance photosynthesis more effectively than others.
2. **Soil Moisture Dynamics:** Conduct experiments focusing on the temporal dynamics of soil moisture, assessing how varying irrigation schedules impact biomass production.
3. **Temperature Variability:** Explore the effects of diurnal temperature variations on growth, as fluctuating temperatures may mimic natural conditions and influence plant responses.
4. **Nutrient Interactions:** Examine the role of nutrient availability in conjunction with the identified optimal environmental parameters to understand their combined effects on TAGP.
5. **Long-term Studies:** Implement long-term growth studies to assess the sustainability of the identified optimal conditions and their impact on overall crop yield.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified key environmental parameters that maximize TAGP for sugar beet in a greenhouse setting. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data led to a focused exploration of high irradiance, moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture levels. The findings underscore the relevance of these conditions for enhancing biomass production and provide a foundation for future greenhouse experiments. The insights gained from this study contribute to the broader understanding of plant growth dynamics and offer valuable guidance for optimizing agricultural practices in controlled environments.
