# Greenhouse Biomass Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment, specifically targeting the Total Above Ground Production (TAGP). The initial biomass is set at 0.41 kg/ha, and the experiment will systematically manipulate several environmental parameters to identify optimal conditions for growth.

The optimization parameters include irradiance (irrad), daily minimum and maximum temperatures (tmin, tmax), daily mean vapor pressure (vap), wind speed (wind), daily rainfall (rain), initial water content in the soil profile (wav), and maximum moisture content in the rooting depth zone (SMLIM). Each parameter has defined bounds, ensuring that the experimental conditions remain realistic and manageable.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to explore this multi-dimensional parameter space efficiently. BO will utilize a probabilistic model to predict TAGP based on the current parameter settings, iteratively refining its search based on observed outcomes. When the optimization process plateaus, I will suggest new points to explore, focusing on regions of the parameter space that show potential for higher TAGP. This adaptive approach aims to identify the optimal conditions for maximizing biomass production, ultimately contributing to more efficient agricultural practices in controlled environments.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse conditions that could potentially maximize TAGP. The hypotheses generated consider various parameter interactions and expected plant responses to environmental factors. The selected points represent a range of conditions, from moderate to extreme, to capture the effects of different parameter combinations on biomass production. Notably, the maximum irradiance is set at 8000 kJ/m2/day, which is at the upper limit of the defined bounds, while temperature extremes are also explored within their respective ranges. The hypotheses emphasize the importance of balancing irradiance, temperature, moisture, and humidity to optimize growth conditions. This approach will help us identify promising regions in the parameter space for further exploration, particularly focusing on the interplay between high light conditions and adequate moisture levels, which may reveal the plants' tolerance and maximize biomass production.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### Moderate Irradiance and Temperature

*Rationale:* Moderate levels of irradiance and temperature are expected to promote optimal photosynthesis and growth without causing stress to the plants.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 4000, 'tmin': 15, 'tmax': 25, 'vap': 2, 'wind': 1, 'rain': 5, 'wav': 50, 'SMLIM': 0.5}

#### High Irradiance with Controlled Temperature

*Rationale:* High irradiance combined with controlled temperatures may enhance photosynthetic rates, leading to increased biomass production.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 7500, 'tmin': 10, 'tmax': 30, 'vap': 1, 'wind': 0.5, 'rain': 2, 'wav': 30, 'SMLIM': 0.4}

#### Optimal Moisture and Temperature

*Rationale:* Maintaining optimal moisture levels while ensuring a suitable temperature range can enhance root development and overall plant health.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 3000, 'tmin': 12, 'tmax': 22, 'vap': 3, 'wind': 0.2, 'rain': 10, 'wav': 70, 'SMLIM': 0.6}

#### High Humidity and Low Wind

*Rationale:* High vapor pressure and low wind speed can create a humid environment that may reduce transpiration stress on the plants, promoting growth.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 2000, 'tmin': 18, 'tmax': 28, 'vap': 8, 'wind': 0.1, 'rain': 0, 'wav': 80, 'SMLIM': 0.7}

#### Extreme Irradiance with Adequate Water

*Rationale:* Exploring the upper limits of irradiance with sufficient water may reveal the plants' tolerance to high light conditions, potentially leading to increased biomass.

*Confidence:* low

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 8000, 'tmin': 20, 'tmax': 35, 'vap': 4, 'wind': 1.5, 'rain': 1, 'wav': 90, 'SMLIM': 0.8}

## Iteration 22

As we progress through iteration 21, the data reveals several insights into the relationship between the experimental parameters and TAGP. The highest TAGP observed is 10.00 kg/ha at an irradiance of 7480.45 kJ/m2/day, with a minimum temperature of 16.54°C and a maximum temperature of 17.78°C. This suggests that moderate temperatures combined with high irradiance are beneficial for biomass production. Conversely, conditions with extreme temperatures or low irradiance, such as those seen in iterations 4 and 14, consistently yield low TAGP values, indicating detrimental effects on growth. The promising subspaces for maximizing TAGP appear to be around high irradiance (approximately 7400-8000 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (around 15-25°C). In contrast, subspaces with low irradiance and extreme temperature variations seem to minimize TAGP. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly and proposing new ones that align with the observed data trends. The new hypotheses will focus on maintaining high irradiance while optimizing temperature and moisture levels to enhance biomass production. The data suggests that maintaining a balance between high light conditions and adequate moisture is crucial for maximizing TAGP.

## Iteration 32

As we reach iteration 31, the data provides valuable insights into the relationships between the experimental parameters and TAGP. The highest TAGP observed is 10.28 kg/ha, achieved with an irradiance of 7812.73 kJ/m2/day and moderate temperatures. The promising subspaces for maximizing TAGP are centered around high irradiance (approximately 7400-8000 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (15-25°C). Notably, conditions with extreme temperatures or low irradiance consistently yield lower TAGP values, particularly those with temperatures below 10°C or above 30°C, and irradiance below 4000 kJ/m2/day. The data suggests that maintaining a balance between high light conditions and adequate moisture is crucial for maximizing biomass production. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that performed poorly, such as 'Exploring Lower Irradiance with High Moisture,' which did not yield competitive TAGP values. New hypotheses will focus on optimizing the identified promising regions while considering moisture levels and wind conditions, particularly emphasizing the importance of low wind speeds in conjunction with high irradiance and moderate temperatures to enhance growth and reduce stress.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of conditions, exploring various combinations of irradiance, temperature, moisture, and wind. As the experiments progressed, it became clear that high irradiance (approximately 7400-8000 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (15-25°C) were consistently associated with higher TAGP values. 

The data revealed that extreme temperatures or low irradiance negatively impacted biomass production, leading to the refinement of hypotheses to emphasize maintaining high light conditions while optimizing moisture levels and minimizing wind stress. Hypotheses that did not yield competitive TAGP values were discarded, while those that aligned with successful patterns were retained and further refined. 

By the final iterations, the hypotheses were more focused, targeting specific combinations of high irradiance, moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture levels. This iterative process allowed for a more systematic exploration of the parameter space, ultimately leading to improved confidence in the selected hypotheses.
