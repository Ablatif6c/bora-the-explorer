# BORA for TAGP Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment yielded a maximum TAGP of 10.35 kg/ha. The most effective parameters identified included high irradiance levels (around 7900 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperature ranges (12-25°C). The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data allowed for a focused exploration of parameter combinations, ultimately leading to significant insights into the environmental conditions that optimize biomass production.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of this optimization process was to identify the optimal environmental parameters that maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a greenhouse setting.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses were broad and aimed at exploring various combinations of irradiance, temperature, moisture, and other environmental factors. Key hypotheses included:

1. **Moderate Irradiance and Temperature:** This hypothesis posited that a balanced approach with moderate irradiance and temperature would promote steady growth.
2. **High Irradiance and Temperature:** This hypothesis suggested that high irradiance combined with elevated temperatures could enhance photosynthesis, albeit with potential heat stress.
3. **Optimal Moisture Conditions:** This hypothesis focused on maximizing soil moisture while maintaining moderate temperatures to support root development.
4. **Low Wind and High Rainfall:** This hypothesis examined the effects of low wind and high rainfall on creating a humid environment conducive to growth.
5. **Extreme Temperature Range:** This hypothesis explored the resilience of biomass production under variable temperature conditions.

These hypotheses were based on existing scientific literature regarding plant growth dynamics in controlled environments.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization process, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on observed performance. The focus shifted towards high irradiance levels (7500-8000 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperature ranges (10-25°C). The initial exploration of extreme temperature ranges was discarded due to consistently poor performance, while hypotheses emphasizing moisture levels were refined to better understand their impact on biomass production.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing sample was achieved with the following parameters:

- **Irradiance:** 7950 kJ/m2/day
- **Minimum Temperature:** 14°C
- **Maximum Temperature:** 23°C
- **Vapor Pressure:** 4 kPa
- **Wind Speed:** 1 m/s
- **Rainfall:** 5 mm
- **Water in Soil Profile:** 55 cm
- **SMLIM:** 0.6
- **TAGP:** 10.35 kg/ha

Conversely, the worst-performing sample was characterized by extreme temperature conditions:

- **Irradiance:** 5000 kJ/m2/day
- **Minimum Temperature:** -5°C
- **Maximum Temperature:** 30°C
- **Vapor Pressure:** 4 kPa
- **Wind Speed:** 1.5 m/s
- **Rainfall:** 0 mm
- **Water in Soil Profile:** 20 cm
- **SMLIM:** 0.4
- **TAGP:** 0.41 kg/ha

The results align with known greenhouse phenomena, where high light availability and moderate temperatures are critical for maximizing photosynthesis and growth. Unexpectedly, the influence of vapor pressure on biomass production was more pronounced than initially anticipated, suggesting that humidity levels play a crucial role in optimizing TAGP.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Vapor Pressure Effects:** Further studies should investigate the specific effects of varying vapor pressure levels on biomass production, as this parameter showed significant influence in the current experiments.
2. **Longitudinal Studies:** Conducting longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of high irradiance and moisture levels on sugar beet growth could provide insights into sustainability and yield consistency.
3. **Diverse Crop Testing:** Applying the optimized parameters to other crops could help determine the generalizability of the findings and potentially uncover new insights into crop-specific growth dynamics.
4. **Microclimate Management:** Investigating the impact of microclimate management techniques, such as shading or misting, could enhance growth conditions and further optimize TAGP.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified key parameters that maximize TAGP in sugar beet cultivation, culminating in a maximum TAGP of 10.35 kg/ha. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data allowed for a focused exploration of effective parameter combinations. The findings underscore the importance of high irradiance and moderate temperature ranges, while also highlighting the role of moisture and vapor pressure in biomass production. These insights are relevant not only for future greenhouse experiments but also for the broader understanding of plant growth dynamics in controlled environments. The knowledge gained from this study can inform future research and practical applications in agricultural practices, ultimately contributing to improved crop yields and sustainability.
