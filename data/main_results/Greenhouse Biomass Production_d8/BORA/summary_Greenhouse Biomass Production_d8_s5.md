# BORA for TAGP Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment yielded significant insights. The highest TAGP recorded was 10.41 kg/ha, achieved under conditions of high irradiance (8000 kJ/m²/day) and moderate temperatures (10°C to 20°C). The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data led to a focused exploration of parameter combinations, emphasizing the importance of balancing light, temperature, and moisture for optimal biomass production.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal environmental parameters that maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a greenhouse setting.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses proposed a diverse range of parameter combinations, including:

1. **High Irradiance and Temperature:** This hypothesis suggested that increased light availability would enhance photosynthesis and growth rates.
2. **Moderate Irradiance with Optimal Moisture:** This hypothesis aimed to explore the effects of moderate light levels combined with optimal soil moisture, hypothesizing that this balance would promote growth.
3. **Controlled Irradiance with Low Wind:** This hypothesis posited that minimizing wind stress while maintaining controlled light levels would improve plant resilience.
4. **High Irradiance with Controlled Rainfall:** This hypothesis explored the potential benefits of high light levels coupled with optimal hydration.
5. **Avoid Extreme Conditions:** This hypothesis aimed to identify conditions that would prevent stress on the plants, particularly avoiding extreme temperatures.

These hypotheses were grounded in established scientific principles regarding plant growth and environmental interactions.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization process, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on the data collected. The following shifts were notable:

- **Irradiance:** The focus shifted towards the upper limit of irradiance (8000 kJ/m²/day), as higher light levels consistently correlated with increased TAGP.
- **Temperature:** The optimal temperature range was refined to 10°C to 20°C, avoiding extremes that negatively impacted growth.
- **Moisture Levels:** Adjustments were made to maintain optimal soil moisture, with a focus on balancing water availability without causing stress.

These adjustments were driven by the observed performance of different parameter combinations and the need to optimize conditions for biomass production.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing sample was achieved with the following parameters:

- **Irradiance:** 8000 kJ/m²/day
- **tmin:** 10°C
- **tmax:** 20°C
- **vap:** 2.00 kPa
- **wind:** 0.50 m/s
- **rain:** 5.00 mm
- **wav:** 75.00 cm
- **SMLIM:** 0.50

This combination resulted in a TAGP of 10.41 kg/ha, demonstrating the effectiveness of high light levels and moderate temperatures in promoting biomass production. Conversely, the worst-performing samples, particularly those with extreme temperature conditions (e.g., negative minimum temperatures), consistently resulted in TAGP as low as 0.41 kg/ha.

The optimization outcomes align with known greenhouse phenomena, where high light availability enhances photosynthesis, while extreme temperatures can lead to stress and reduced growth. The findings underscore the importance of maintaining a balanced environment to optimize plant health and productivity.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Additional Moisture Levels:** Future studies could investigate a wider range of soil moisture levels to determine if there are optimal thresholds that further enhance TAGP.
2. **Longitudinal Studies on Temperature Effects:** Conducting experiments over longer periods could provide insights into how temperature fluctuations impact growth and biomass accumulation.
3. **Investigation of Nutrient Interactions:** Exploring the effects of different nutrient levels in conjunction with the identified optimal environmental parameters could yield further improvements in biomass production.
4. **Testing Different Crop Varieties:** Future experiments could include different sugar beet varieties to assess their responsiveness to the identified optimal conditions.

Additionally, the optimization process could be enhanced by incorporating more advanced machine learning techniques to predict outcomes based on a broader set of parameters.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified the conditions that maximize TAGP for sugar beet in a greenhouse environment, with the highest recorded TAGP of 10.41 kg/ha. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data allowed for a focused exploration of parameter combinations, emphasizing the importance of high irradiance, moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture levels. The findings contribute valuable insights to the field of greenhouse agriculture and highlight the relevance of maintaining balanced environmental conditions for maximizing plant productivity. Future experiments can build on these results to further enhance our understanding of plant growth dynamics in controlled environments.
