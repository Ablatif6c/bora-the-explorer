# Greenhouse Biomass Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment, specifically targeting the Total Above Ground Production (TAGP). The initial biomass is set at 0.41 kg/ha, and the experiment will systematically manipulate several environmental parameters to identify optimal conditions for growth.

The optimization parameters include irradiance (irrad), daily minimum and maximum temperatures (tmin, tmax), daily mean vapor pressure (vap), wind speed (wind), rainfall (rain), initial water content in the soil profile (wav), and maximum moisture content in the rooting depth zone (SMLIM). Each parameter has defined bounds, ensuring that the experimental conditions remain realistic and manageable.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to explore this multi-dimensional parameter space efficiently. BO will utilize a probabilistic model to predict TAGP based on the current parameter settings, iteratively refining its search based on observed outcomes. When the optimization process plateaus, I will suggest new points to explore, focusing on regions of the parameter space that show potential for higher TAGP. This adaptive approach aims to identify the optimal conditions for maximizing biomass production, ultimately contributing to more efficient agricultural practices in controlled environments.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse hypotheses that leverage the relationships between environmental parameters and biomass production. The hypotheses are designed to cover a range of conditions, from moderate to extreme, to identify promising regions in the parameter space. Each hypothesis considers the expected interactions between light, temperature, moisture, and other factors that influence TAGP. For instance, high irradiance levels can enhance photosynthesis, but must be balanced with temperature to avoid stress. Similarly, optimal moisture levels are crucial for growth, while low wind speeds can reduce water loss. By sampling these points, we can gather valuable data to inform the Bayesian Optimization process and refine our search for optimal conditions. The proposed points are within the defined bounds, ensuring realistic experimental conditions.

## Iteration 18

As we progress through iteration 17 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest TAGP observed is 10.07, achieved with parameters around high irradiance (7507.63 kJ/m2/day), moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture content. This suggests that a combination of high irradiance and suitable temperature ranges is crucial for maximizing biomass production. Conversely, conditions with extreme temperatures, such as the point with 8000 kJ/m2/day irradiance and a minimum temperature of -10°C, resulted in significantly lower TAGP, indicating that extreme conditions can be detrimental. The data also shows that high vapor pressure and low wind speeds tend to correlate with better biomass production. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses based on these findings, focusing on the promising subspaces while discarding those that consistently underperform. The promising subspaces include high irradiance levels (around 7500 kJ/m2/day) with moderate temperatures (15-28°C) and optimal moisture content, while detrimental conditions include extreme temperatures and low moisture levels.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of conditions, exploring various combinations of irradiance, temperature, moisture, and other parameters. As the experiments progressed, we observed specific trends and relationships that informed our subsequent hypotheses.

For instance, high irradiance levels consistently correlated with increased biomass production, particularly when paired with moderate temperatures and optimal moisture content. This led to a refinement of hypotheses that emphasized maintaining high irradiance while ensuring temperatures remained within a favorable range. Additionally, the importance of moisture balance became evident, prompting us to explore hypotheses that focused on the interplay between moisture and temperature.

As we gathered more data, we also identified detrimental conditions, such as extreme temperatures and low moisture levels, which consistently resulted in lower TAGP. Consequently, hypotheses were adjusted to eliminate these extreme conditions and focus on more promising parameter combinations.

The following table summarizes the evolution of confidence in the hypotheses throughout the optimization process:

| Hypothesis Name                          | Initial Confidence | Final Confidence |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| High Irradiance with Moderate Temperature | Medium             | High             |
| Balanced Moisture and Temperature        | Medium             | High             |
| Low Wind and High Humidity               | Medium             | Medium           |
| Moderate Irradiance with High Moisture   | Medium             | Medium           |
| Eliminate Extreme Conditions              | Low                | Low              |

This iterative refinement process allowed us to systematically hone in on the optimal conditions for maximizing TAGP in sugar beet production.
