# Greenhouse Biomass Production

## Experiment Overview

The primary goal of this experiment is to maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment, specifically targeting the Total Above Ground Production (TAGP). The initial biomass is set at 0.41 kg/ha, and the experiment will systematically manipulate several environmental parameters to identify optimal conditions for growth.

The optimization parameters include irradiance (irrad), daily minimum and maximum temperatures (tmin, tmax), daily mean vapor pressure (vap), wind speed (wind), daily rainfall (rain), initial water content in the soil profile (wav), and maximum moisture content in the rooting depth zone (SMLIM). Each parameter has defined bounds, ensuring that the experimental conditions remain realistic and feasible.

Bayesian Optimization (BO) will be employed to explore this multi-dimensional parameter space efficiently. BO will utilize a probabilistic model to predict TAGP based on the current parameter settings, iteratively refining its search based on observed outcomes. When the optimization process plateaus, I will suggest new points to explore, focusing on regions of the parameter space that show potential for higher TAGP. This adaptive approach aims to identify the optimal conditions for maximizing biomass production, ultimately contributing to more efficient agricultural practices in controlled environments.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse hypotheses that could lead to maximizing TAGP in sugar beet cultivation. The hypotheses are designed to cover a range of parameter combinations, considering the relationships between environmental factors and plant growth. The selected points reflect promising regions of the parameter space based on expected behaviors, such as the influence of temperature and irradiance on biomass production. Notably, the maximum irradiance is set at 8000 kJ/m2/day, and the temperature bounds are -30°C to 50°C, which allows for a wide exploration of conditions. The hypotheses emphasize the importance of balancing irradiance, temperature, moisture, and humidity to create optimal growth conditions. As we proceed, these hypotheses will guide our exploration and help identify optimal conditions for TAGP, while also allowing for adjustments based on observed outcomes.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### High Irradiance and Warm Temperature

*Rationale:* High irradiance combined with warm temperatures is expected to enhance photosynthesis and biomass production.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 7500, 'tmin': 20, 'tmax': 30, 'vap': 5, 'wind': 1, 'rain': 5, 'wav': 50, 'SMLIM': 0.8}

*Rationale:* Moderate temperatures with adequate moisture levels can promote healthy growth without stress.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 4000, 'tmin': 15, 'tmax': 25, 'vap': 3, 'wind': 0.5, 'rain': 10, 'wav': 70, 'SMLIM': 0.6}

#### Cooler Temperatures with High Irradiance

*Rationale:* Cooler temperatures may reduce stress while high irradiance supports growth, potentially leading to optimal biomass.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'irrad': 7000, 'tmin': 10, 'tmax': 20, 'vap': 4, 'wind': 2, 'rain': 2, 'wav': 30, 'SMLIM': 0.5}

## Iteration 12

As we progress through iteration 11 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest TAGP observed so far is 9.66 kg/ha, achieved with a combination of high irradiance (7000 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (tmin 10°C, tmax 20°C). This suggests that a balance of high light availability and controlled temperature can significantly enhance biomass production. Conversely, conditions with low irradiance and high rainfall (e.g., iteration 4 with TAGP of 2.06) appear detrimental, indicating that excessive moisture may hinder growth. The data suggests that subspaces with high irradiance (around 7000-7500 kJ/m2/day) and moderate temperatures (15-30°C) are promising for maximizing TAGP, while low irradiance and high humidity conditions should be avoided. Based on these findings, I will refine the previous hypotheses, discarding those that consistently performed poorly and proposing new ones that align with the observed successful conditions.

In light of this, I will propose new points for the hypotheses that maintain the focus on high irradiance while varying other parameters to explore their effects on TAGP. This approach will help us identify the most effective conditions for maximizing biomass production in sugar beet cultivation.

The data collected thus far indicates that high irradiance combined with low humidity and controlled temperatures are key factors for optimal biomass production. The promising subspaces remain those with irradiance levels between 7400-7700 kJ/m2/day, low vapor pressure, and moderate temperatures (around 18-30u00b0C). Based on these insights, I will propose new points for the hypotheses that maintain the focus on high irradiance while varying other parameters to explore their effects on TAGP.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broad range of parameter combinations, exploring various irradiance levels, temperature ranges, and moisture conditions. As the experiments progressed, it became clear that high irradiance (around 7400-7700 kJ/m2/day) combined with controlled temperatures and low humidity were critical for maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP).

The data revealed that certain combinations consistently yielded higher TAGP, prompting a refinement of the hypotheses. For instance, hypotheses emphasizing high irradiance with low vapor pressure and moderate temperatures were prioritized, while those with low irradiance or excessive moisture were discarded due to their poor performance. This iterative process allowed for a more targeted exploration of the parameter space, leading to increasingly confident predictions about optimal conditions for biomass production.

The following table summarizes the evolution of confidence in the hypotheses throughout the optimization:

| Hypothesis Name                          | Initial Confidence | Final Confidence |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| High Irradiance with Controlled Temperature | High               | High             |
| High Irradiance with Low Humidity        | Medium             | High             |
| Moderate Irradiance with Optimal Moisture | Medium             | Medium           |
| High Irradiance and Low Rainfall         | High               | High             |
| High Irradiance with Slightly Elevated Temperature | Medium       | Medium           |

This structured approach to hypothesis refinement ultimately led to a more effective identification of conditions that maximize TAGP in sugar beet cultivation.
