# BORA for TAGP Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process aimed at maximizing Total Above Ground Production (TAGP) of sugar beet in a controlled greenhouse environment yielded a maximum TAGP of 10.3 kg/ha. The most effective parameters identified included high irradiance levels (approximately 7800-8000 kJ/m2/day) combined with moderate temperatures (15-25째C) and optimal moisture conditions. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data allowed for a focused exploration of parameter interactions, ultimately leading to significant insights into the conditions that promote biomass production.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal environmental parameters that maximize the monthly biomass production of sugar beet in a greenhouse setting.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses proposed a diverse set of conditions based on existing knowledge of plant growth dynamics. These included:

1. **Moderate Irradiance and Temperature:** Expected to promote optimal photosynthesis and growth.
2. **High Irradiance with Controlled Temperature:** Aimed to enhance photosynthetic rates.
3. **Optimal Moisture and Temperature:** Focused on maintaining moisture levels conducive to root development.
4. **High Humidity and Low Wind:** Intended to create a stable environment reducing transpiration stress.
5. **Extreme Irradiance with Adequate Water:** Explored the plants' tolerance to high light conditions.

These hypotheses were grounded in the understanding that light, temperature, and moisture are critical factors influencing plant growth.

|-----------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Moderate Irradiance and Temperature         | Confirmed      | Supported by initial data showing moderate conditions yield better TAGP. |
| 2         | High Irradiance with Controlled Temperature  | Confirmed      | High TAGP observed with high irradiance and moderate temperatures. |
| 3         | Optimal Moisture and Temperature            | Refined        | Adjusted moisture levels based on performance data.      |
| 4         | High Humidity and Low Wind                  | Discarded      | Consistently low TAGP values indicated this combination was not effective. |
| 5         | Extreme Irradiance with Adequate Water     | Discarded      | High light conditions without adequate moisture led to stress and low TAGP. |
| 22        | High Irradiance with Moderate Temperature    | Confirmed      | Continued support from data showing high TAGP in this region. |
| 32        | Optimal Moisture with High Irradiance       | Confirmed      | Consistent results reinforced the importance of moisture. |
| 44        | Balanced Irradiance and Temperature          | Refined        | Adjusted to explore wider temperature ranges.            |

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization process, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on observed TAGP outcomes. The focus shifted towards high irradiance levels, particularly in the range of 7800-8000 kJ/m2/day, while maintaining moderate temperatures (15-25째C). The moisture levels were also fine-tuned, with optimal conditions identified around 70-90 cm of water in the soil profile. Wind speed was minimized to reduce stress on the plants, with values consistently kept below 1 m/s.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing sample was identified at an irradiance of 7812.73 kJ/m2/day, with a minimum temperature of 14.48째C, a maximum temperature of 16.41째C, and a TAGP of 10.28 kg/ha. This combination aligns with known greenhouse phenomena where high light availability and moderate temperatures facilitate optimal photosynthesis and growth.

Conversely, the worst-performing sample was recorded at an irradiance of 794.40 kJ/m2/day, with extreme temperatures and low moisture, resulting in a TAGP of only 0.41 kg/ha. This outcome underscores the detrimental effects of low light and extreme temperature variations on biomass production.

The optimization outcomes revealed that maintaining a balance between high light conditions and adequate moisture is crucial for maximizing TAGP. The data also indicated that while high irradiance is beneficial, it must be coupled with appropriate temperature and moisture levels to avoid stress and ensure healthy growth.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments can be made:

1. **Exploration of Additional Moisture Levels:** Further investigation into varying moisture levels beyond the current optimal range may yield insights into the plants' tolerance and growth dynamics under different water availability scenarios.
   
2. **Longitudinal Studies on Temperature Effects:** Conducting long-term studies to assess the impact of gradual temperature changes on TAGP could provide valuable data on plant resilience and adaptation.

3. **Incorporation of Nutrient Variables:** Future experiments could benefit from integrating nutrient management into the optimization process, as nutrient availability may significantly influence biomass production.

4. **Testing Different Crop Varieties:** Exploring the effects of different sugar beet varieties under the identified optimal conditions could reveal genetic factors that contribute to enhanced growth and yield.

5. **Advanced Environmental Controls:** Implementing more sophisticated environmental controls, such as automated irrigation and temperature regulation systems, could help maintain optimal conditions more effectively.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process successfully identified key parameters that maximize TAGP in sugar beet cultivation within a greenhouse environment. The iterative refinement of hypotheses based on experimental data allowed for a focused exploration of parameter interactions, leading to significant insights into the conditions that promote biomass production. The findings underscore the importance of high irradiance, moderate temperatures, and optimal moisture levels in achieving maximum growth. These insights are not only relevant for future greenhouse experiments but also contribute to the broader understanding of plant growth dynamics and environmental interactions in controlled agricultural systems. The knowledge gained from this study can inform future research and practical applications in optimizing crop production in greenhouse settings.
