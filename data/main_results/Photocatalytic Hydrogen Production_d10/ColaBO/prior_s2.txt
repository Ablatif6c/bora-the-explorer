    "rationale":"To ensure that the sum of all parameters excluding P10-MIX1 does not exceed 5, I adjusted the values more conservatively while still aiming to utilize functional additives. P10-MIX1 is kept high as it is expected to contribute significantly to hydrogen evolution, while the other parameters have been reduced correspondingly to comply with the constraint. This approach allows for maximizing hydrogen production while respecting the limitations of the experiment.",
