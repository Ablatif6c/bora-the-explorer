    "rationale":"Based on the understanding of photocatalytic processes, the presence of hole scavengers like L-Cysteine can significantly enhance hydrogen production. Additionally, using an effective photosensitizer can improve light absorption and increase reaction efficiency. Therefore, I suggest a moderate concentration of AcidRed871, L-Cysteine, and MethyleneB, while minimizing other components to keep within the constraint. Keeping P10-MIX1 high leverages its role as a photocatalyst. The proposed configuration balances these factors optimally.",
