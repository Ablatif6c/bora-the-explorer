    "rationale":"Based on the known roles of each component in photocatalytic processes, I propose a higher concentration of P10-MIX1, as it is a promising photocatalyst. The total of the other components is constrained to ensure we stay below the maximum sum of 5. By employing a balanced mix of hole scavenger (L-Cysteine), surfactants (SDS), and a photosensitizer (MethyleneB), along with a modest amount of salt (NaCl) to control ionic strength, I aim for a combination that promotes effective charge separation and enhances overall HER efficiency.",
