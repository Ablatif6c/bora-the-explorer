    "rationale":"In optimizing the hydrogen evolution rate, it is important to balance the parameters that enhance photocatalysis and charge separation. Based on general knowledge of photocatalytic mechanisms, employing a significant amount of P10-MIX1 (the effective photocatalyst) is crucial; hence, setting it to 5. To accommodate this, the remaining parameters must sum to 0. The combination caters to maximizing the contribution from the catalyst while adhering to the constraints set for the remaining chemicals. As traditional hole scavengers, L-Cysteine can remain at a minimal level to not exceed the sum constraint, therefore 0 is appropriate for it and others as well. The use of minimal amounts of dyes is likely to have a negligible effect compared to the effective photocatalyst, also suggesting setting them to 0.",
