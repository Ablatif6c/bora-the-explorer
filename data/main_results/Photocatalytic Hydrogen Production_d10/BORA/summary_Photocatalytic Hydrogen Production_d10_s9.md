## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The primary goal of the optimization process was to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize the Hydrogen Evolution Rate (HER) from a photocatalyst mixture under UV and visible light exposure.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
The initial hypotheses were formulated based on the roles of various chemicals in photocatalytic processes. Key hypotheses included:

1. **Maximize Hole Scavenging:** L-Cysteine was hypothesized to enhance charge separation, improving HER.
2. **Dye Synergy Exploration:** The combination of AcidRed871 and MethyleneB was expected to create a synergistic effect, enhancing light absorption.
3. **Surfactant Influence:** Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was anticipated to improve photocatalyst dispersion, enhancing HER.
4. **High Concentration of P10-MIX1:** Maximizing P10-MIX1 was expected to yield higher HER due to its effectiveness as a photocatalyst.
5. **Balanced Chemical Mixture:** A balanced approach with moderate concentrations of multiple components was hypothesized to optimize interactions and enhance HER.

These hypotheses were grounded in established chemical principles regarding photocatalysis and the roles of various additives.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Throughout the optimization, significant adjustments were made to the parameters based on experimental feedback. The most notable changes included:

- **Increased L-Cysteine Concentration:** Higher concentrations of L-Cysteine were consistently linked to improved HER, confirming its role as a hole scavenger.
- **Maximized P10-MIX1:** The concentration of P10-MIX1 was maintained at high levels, as it was crucial for effective photocatalysis.
- **Minimized Dye Concentrations:** Reducing the presence of dyes, particularly AcidRed871 and MethyleneB, was essential as they were found to hinder HER.

These adjustments were guided by the iterative feedback from the Bayesian Optimization process, which allowed for systematic exploration of the parameter space.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing sample was achieved with the following parameters:

- **AcidRed871_0gL:** 0.0
- **L-Cysteine-100gL:** 1.5
- **MethyleneB_250mgL:** 0.0
- **NaCl-3M:** 0.0
- **NaOH-1M:** 0.75
- **P10-MIX1:** 4.6
- **PVP-1wt:** 0.0
- **RhodamineB1_0gL:** 0.0
- **SDS-1wt:** 0.0
- **Sodiumsilicate-1wt:** 0.0
- **Hydrogen Evolution Rate:** 23.48 µmol/h

Conversely, the worst-performing sample was characterized by high dye concentrations and low concentrations of L-Cysteine and P10-MIX1, resulting in negligible HER.

The optimization outcomes align with known chemistry behaviors, particularly the role of hole scavengers in enhancing charge separation and the detrimental effects of excessive dye concentrations on photocatalytic efficiency. The findings reinforce the importance of optimizing the balance between photocatalyst concentration and hole scavengers to maximize HER.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the optimization results, several recommendations for future experiments are proposed:

1. **Explore Alternative Hole Scavengers:** Investigating other amino acids or organic compounds that may enhance charge separation could yield further improvements in HER.
2. **Dye Variations:** Testing a broader range of dyes with different absorption spectra may uncover new synergies or antagonistic effects on HER.
3. **Parameter Interactions:** Conducting factorial experiments to systematically explore interactions between multiple parameters could provide deeper insights into their combined effects on HER.
4. **Long-term Stability Studies:** Assessing the stability of the optimized photocatalyst mixture over extended periods could provide valuable information on its practical applicability.
5. **Scale-up Experiments:** Transitioning from small-scale experiments to larger systems could help evaluate the scalability of the findings and their relevance in real-world applications.
