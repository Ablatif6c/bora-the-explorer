## Iteration 22

Upon reviewing the data from the first 21 iterations, it is clear that certain parameter combinations yield significantly higher Hydrogen Evolution Rates (HER). The highest observed HER value is 12.36 µmol/h from iteration 14, which features a combination of L-Cysteine, NaCl, and P10-MIX1, indicating that these parameters are critical for enhancing HER. Iterations 12 and 13 also show promising results with HER values of 7.45 and 7.89 µmol/h, respectively, both benefiting from higher concentrations of L-Cysteine and specific combinations of surfactants and salts. Conversely, combinations with high concentrations of Methylene Blue and low or no L-Cysteine, such as in iterations 2, 3, and 17, resulted in negligible HER, highlighting the detrimental effect of these parameters.    Moving forward, I will refine the hypotheses based on these insights, focusing on combinations that have shown potential while discarding those that consistently underperform. The new hypotheses will target the identified subspaces that maximize HER while avoiding detrimental combinations, particularly emphasizing the importance of L-Cysteine and the careful balancing of ionic strength with NaCl.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data collected from each iteration. Initially, the focus was on exploring a wide range of parameters, including various dyes, hole scavengers, and surfactants, to identify potential combinations that could enhance the Hydrogen Evolution Rate (HER). However, as data accumulated, it became evident that certain parameters, particularly L-Cysteine and NaCl, consistently yielded higher HER values. 

In later iterations, the hypotheses were refined to emphasize combinations that included higher concentrations of L-Cysteine while minimizing the use of detrimental dyes like Methylene Blue. The rationale shifted towards optimizing charge separation and ionic strength, which were critical for enhancing HER. Additionally, the role of surfactants was explored more thoroughly, focusing on their potential to stabilize the photocatalyst and improve charge dynamics.

As a result, the confidence in hypotheses that centered around L-Cysteine and NaCl increased, while those involving high concentrations of detrimental dyes were discarded or minimized. This iterative learning process allowed for a more targeted exploration of the parameter space, ultimately leading to more effective combinations for maximizing HER.
