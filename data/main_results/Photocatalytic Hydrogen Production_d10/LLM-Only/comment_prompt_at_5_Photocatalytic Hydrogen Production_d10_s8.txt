Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 5.
5 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.


Currently the dataset contains 5 experiments:
 iteration  AcidRed871_0gL  L-Cysteine-100gL  MethyleneB_250mgL  NaCl-3M  NaOH-1M  P10-MIX1  PVP-1wt  RhodamineB1_0gL  SDS-1wt  Sodiumsilicate-1wt  Hydrogen Evolution Rate (Âµmol/h)

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize Hydrogen Evolution Rate (Âµmol/h) the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize Hydrogen Evolution Rate (Âµmol/h)?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing Hydrogen Evolution Rate (Âµmol/h) in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point which satisfies the experiment constraint, you want evaluate next.
