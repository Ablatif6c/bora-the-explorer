**Task:**
For the initial sampling step, using your general knowledge of chemistry and the experiment description, generate a diverse set of 5 initial hypotheses for maximizing Hydrogen Evolution Rate (Âµmol/h). Consider parameter relationships, expected behaviors, and promising regions of the parameter space.

Note: For this initialization step, for each hypothesis, give a single point for which the sum of all parameters excluding P10-MIX1 should not exceed 5 to fit inside the vial., and the discretization step sizes of the parameters are respected.

Example response for two hypotheses:
```
{
  "comment":"comment on the optimization progress and highlight the most important findings in about 200 words",
  "hypotheses":
    [
      {
        "name":"short meaningful name here",
        "rationale":"Your rationale here...",
        "confidence": high/medium/low,
        "points":
        [
            {
                "AcidRed871_0gL":0.75,
                "L-Cysteine-100gL":0.75,
                ...,
            },
            {
                "AcidRed871_0gL":0.75,
                "L-Cysteine-100gL":0.75,
                ...,
            },
        ],
      },
      {
        "name":"short meaningful name here",
        "rationale":"...",
        "confidence": high/medium/low,
        "points":
        [
            {
                "AcidRed871_0gL":0.75,
                "L-Cysteine-100gL":0.75,
                ...,
            },
            {
                "AcidRed871_0gL":0.75,
                "L-Cysteine-100gL":0.75,
                ...,
            },
        ],
      }, 
    ]
}
```
