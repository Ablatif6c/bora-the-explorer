## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal settings of 15 input parameters (x_0 to x_14) that maximize a mathematical black-box function. Each parameter is bounded between -30 and 20, providing a defined search space of 50 units for each variable. By leveraging Bayesian Optimization (BO), we aim to systematically explore this high-dimensional parameter space while efficiently handling the uncertainty and noise typically associated with black-box functions.

Bayesian Optimization employs a surrogate model, often a Gaussian Process, to predict the function's behavior across the defined bounds. This allows us to prioritize sampling in areas likely to yield better performance, thus optimizing our search process. As the optimization progresses, BO balances exploration of new regions with exploitation of known high-performing areas.

When the optimization process plateaus—indicating diminishing returns on new search points—I will suggest revisiting previously explored regions by tweaking certain parameters within their bounds. This strategy may uncover hidden optima in non-convex landscapes. The intended outcome is to pinpoint combinations of parameters that yield the highest function value, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the underlying function dynamics and enhancing predictive capabilities.

## Initial Thoughts

The initial sampling step is essential for establishing a foundational understanding of the target function's behavior within the defined parameter space. The proposed hypotheses have been designed to explore a diverse range of conditions to gain insights into potential interactions among parameters. Each hypothesis targets varying regions, including extreme values, mid-range combinations, and unique diverse settings that could reveal hidden optima within the black-box function. Insights from these initial samples should help characterize the function landscape effectively. Given the nature of mathematical functions, particularly in high-dimensional spaces, exploring boundary values may unearth significant behaviors or asymptotic responses, while mid-range selections can provide insights into stability and potential local maxima. The variability among the selections is paramount for effective Bayesian Optimization, ensuring we cover the defined range and stimulate exploration prior to focusing on promising regions based on observed outputs.

## Iteration 41

After thoroughly analyzing the experimental data accumulated from the first 40 iterations, we observe that the highest target value recorded so far is 12.288, reached during iteration 29. This indicates a strong preference for specific combinations of parameters that mainly involve moderate values across the board. The data indicates that several iterations, particularly those exploring the mid-range values surrounding 2 to 5 for several parameters, have yielded substantially improved outputs, suggesting that balanced settings are crucial for maximizing target performance. On the other hand, configurations that explored extreme combinations—demonstrated in iterations 4, 36, 37, and 39—consistently resulted in lower target values. This knowledge emphasizes the importance of avoiding extreme parameter settings and rather focusing on the middle ranges that have shown promising results. Additionally, our modifications to previous hypotheses will guide the exploration of areas where the function has exhibited higher responses while systematically avoiding configurations that limit performance. We propose a focused hypothesis set that continues exploring moderates while cautiously probing into territories slightly outside previously successful ranges to fine-tune our understanding of the parameter interactions related to maximizing the target.

## Iteration 76

As we conclude iteration 75, the analysis of the experimental dataset reveals that the highest recorded target value is 15.442, achieved during iteration 42. This validation underscores the effectiveness of exploring configurations that focus on moderate parameters around the values of 1 to 5, particularly for variables x_1, x_2, and x_4. These moderate combinations consistently yield higher outputs, indicating a clear preference for this area of the parameter space. In contrast, configurations assigned with extreme values, both positively and negatively, have persistently resulted in lower performance outcomes, reinforcing the non-convex nature of the underlying mathematical function. Moreover, while initial explorations of negative configurations yielded mixed results, there is merit in testing configurations that include mild negative values in conjunction with moderate positives, as these may unveil additional beneficial interactions. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to prioritize the promising mid-range values, employ slight variations around successful points, and cautiously probe areas of potential improvement without reverting to extremes that previously underperformed. This strategy aims to uncover local maxima and refine our understanding of the parameter interactions critical for maximizing the target.

## Final Conclusions

Over the course of the Bayesian Optimization process, our hypotheses evolved significantly based on the obtained experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring diverse parameter configurations across the full range of defined bounds. This included extreme value tests as well as exploratory mid-range settings. The results indicated a clear pattern: combinations with moderate values, particularly in the range of 1 to 5 for several parameters, yielded the highest target outputs.

As the optimization progressed, we refined our hypotheses to emphasize these promising mid-range configurations. Recognizing the underperformance of extreme values led us to exclude them in favor of increments from successful points. Our hypotheses began to prioritize slight adjustments around previously high-performing combinations to fine-tune our understanding of parameter interactions and uncover potential local maxima.

Through this iterative learning process, we shifted our focus from broad exploratory hypotheses to more strategic, targeted adjustments. The introduction of cautious examinations of mixed positive and mild negative values emerged, aiming to exploit beneficial interactions without delving back into extremes.
