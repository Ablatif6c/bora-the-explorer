# BORA for Target Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process utilizing Bayesian Optimization (BO) achieved a maximum target output of 14.061 during the 105 experiment iterations. Key findings highlight the importance of parameter interactions, particularly in the positive regions of inputs x_1 and x_3, where effective configurations were predominantly observed. These results emphasize the need for further exploration of subspaces surrounding high-performing parameter combinations, providing valuable insights for future optimizations.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:** The primary aim of this optimization process was to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function, effectively navigating a 15-dimensional parameter space.

**Initial Hypotheses:** At the outset, five initial hypotheses were formulated to guide the first sampling steps:

1. **High-Performance Region Exploration:** Focused on configurations near observed high results to identify potential local maxima. Rationale centered on the belief that successful areas could yield beneficial local configurations.
   
2. **Central Adjustment Point:** Aimed at balanced parameters surrounding previously successful parameters, hypothesizing that slight modifications could lead to improved outcomes by exploring nearby configurations.

3. **Balance of Negatives and Positives:** Proposed a mixture of negative and positive parameter values to investigate interactions in untested areas, based on the assumption that these can offer insights into complex dynamics.

4. **Cautious Boundary Exploration:** Prioritized points near defined boundaries while avoiding previously unproductive areas, taking into account the understanding that edges of regions may hold critical insights without directly repeating adverse points.

5. **New Variable Interaction Zone:** Focused on extreme parameter combinations to assess their influence while remain cautious of established minima, based on the premise that interactions at extremes may yield surprising dynamics.

## 3. Progress Summary

**Key Milestones:**

| Iteration | Comment                                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1-5       | Initial exploration yields low outputs, leading to refinement of hypotheses based on early performance data. |
| 6-10      | Notable performance at configurations leads to enhanced focus on nearby configurations, especially positive peaks. |
| 11-15     | Exploration zones adjusting to avoid known low-performing areas.   |
| 16-20     | Identification of promising parameter sets around (9.989, 12.021, -13.993).                      |
| 21-30     | Shift towards parameters yielding higher outputs; lesser focus on extreme negatives.                |
| 31-40     | Iterative adjustments leading to final peaks, maximizing at 14.061 while determining effective subspaces. |

**Major Parameter Adjustments:** Throughout the optimization process, significant adjustments were made, primarily revolving around the exploration of subspaces defined by previous performance. Parameters were often clustered around promising configurations while selectively disregarding regions yielding consistently poor outputs. Notably:

- The focus shifted from extreme negative configurations, which resulted in outputs below 1.5, to more balanced and slightly positive configurations.
- The emphasis on parameters (x_1, x_3) highlighted their importance in achieving higher outputs; eventually leading to refined sampling that consistently improved return values.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

**Best Sample Outputs:**
- **Highest Performance:** The optimal configuration found was (9.989, 12.021, -13.993, 9.476, -12.830, -23.965, 3.649, -8.476, -20.347, -24.629, 19.850, -3.883, 4.695, -28.515) with a corresponding target output of 14.061.
- **Worst Performance:** The least effective configuration was recorded at (20.000, 20.000, -30.000, -30.000, 20.000, 20.000, -30.000, 0.000, -30.000, -20.000, 10.000, -10.000, -30.000, 15.000, -5.000), leading to a target output of 1.697.

The results align with known mathematical phenomena regarding the optimization of multivariate functions, revealing that parameter interactions can significantly influence output. The unexpectedly high output at positive parameters, especially in regions where x_1 and x_3 were both elevated, highlights underlying correlations that merit further exploration.

**Comparative Performance Analysis:** 
The best-performing set consistently emerged from configurations that harmonized positive and slightly negative values across the majority of parameters. In contrast, consistently poor results were observed with extreme positions (such as both x_0 and x_4 at maximum negative values), suggesting that certain parameter configurations lead to overactive suppression of output.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

1. **Focus on Parameter Interactions:** Continued exploration around high-performing configurations should probe into fine-tuning interactions between parameters to unearth optimal local optima within narrowed ranges.
   
2. **Expanding the Parameter Range:** Future explorations might consider subtle expansions beyond the defined limits of parameters to identify potential beneficial outputs at boundaries.

3. **Adaptive Resampling Strategies:** Developing a dynamic BO strategy capable of reacting to performance shifts in real-time could yield faster convergence to local maxima.

4. **Experimentation with Additional Dimensions:** Exploring additonal dimensions of interaction, possibly incorporating auxiliary parameters or transformations of existing ones, may uncover even richer functional behaviors.

## 6. Conclusion

In conclusion, this optimization process utilizing Bayesian Optimization successfully identified significant target maximization strategies, culminating in an impressive maximum target of 14.061. Initial hypotheses evolved rigorously as experimental data provided deeper insights into parameter interactions and their relevance in achieving high outputs. The study underscores the critical need for thoughtful exploration of effective parameter spaces while avoiding previously deemed detrimental areas. These findings contribute notably to ongoing developments in mathematical function optimization, emphasizing the relevance of Bayesian models in unpacking the complexities of multivariate behaviors. Future inquiries can leverage these insights to refine methods further, enhancing the overall understanding of mathematical optimization landscapes.
