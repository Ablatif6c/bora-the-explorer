## Experiment Overview

The upcoming experiment aims to maximize a mathematical black-box function through Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on a 15-dimensional parameter space defined by the variables x_0 to x_14, each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). The primary goal is to uncover the optimal set of parameter values that yield the highest function output.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this multi-dimensional parameter space. BO leverages a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process, to predict the function’s output based on observed values. This approach allows for efficient sampling of points, guiding the exploration towards regions with high potential while simultaneously balancing exploration and exploitation.

As the optimization progresses, I will help identify when the BO process plateaus—indicating a potential stagnation in finding new high-target values. When this occurs, I will suggest targeted new points to sample, potentially near the current best-known parameters or in unexplored areas, based on the surrogate model. This combined strategy aims to refine our search, ensuring we thoroughly investigate the parameter space and ultimately discover conditions that effectively maximize the target function's output.

## Initial Thoughts

As we embark on the initial sampling step of our Bayesian Optimization experiment, it is essential to approach the exploration of the parameter space with a diverse and strategic mindset. By evaluating hypotheses that span both extremes and central regions, we aim to capture a comprehensive understanding of the function landscape. The hypotheses consider relationships between parameters, their expected behaviors, and interactions that could potentially lead to maximum values. Points are chosen purposefully to investigate not only the extreme boundaries, which often unveil critical features of black-box functions, but also balanced combinations that might indicate stable regions or local maxima. This will allow us to assess variations and their impacts, guiding future sampling efforts intelligently. The interplay of these factors as we explore should enhance our ability to converge toward configurations that yield optimal target outputs.

## Iteration 37

As we progress towards the next iteration of our Bayesian Optimization process, a thorough analysis of the data from the first 36 iterations reveals key insights. The highest recorded target value is approximately 6.193, achieved at the point (9.989, 12.021, -13.993, 9.476, -12.830, -23.965, 3.649, -8.476, -20.347, -24.629, 19.850, -3.883, 4.695, -28.515, 6.193). This performing configuration suggests that there are beneficial subspaces around the positive values of x_0 and x_1, particularly when x_3 is also positive. However, several iterations demonstrate unfavorable outcomes linked to regions with extreme negative values, as evident in configurations like (x_4 < -20) and (x_6 < -25), which consistently yield lower target values (frequently under 1.5). Moving forward, it is essential to refine our exploration strategies focusing on the promising hyperrectangles surrounding previously gathered data, while simultaneously avoiding known detrimental areas. By centering future hypotheses around configurations that yielded higher outputs, alongside an exploration of central values and mixed positive-negative interactions, we can enhance our chances of optimizing the target function effectively.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, our hypotheses have evolved significantly based on a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data collected across 105 iterations. Initially, the hypotheses focused on a broader exploration of the parameter space, targeting diverse combinations of input values that spanned both the positive and negative boundaries. This strategy aimed to identify potential subspaces that might yield higher target values.

As the iterations progressed, we began to observe specific patterns and correlations among the parameter values, particularly in relation to the highest recorded target value of approximately 6.193 achieved at the configuration (9.989, 12.021, -13.993, 9.476, -12.830, -23.965, 3.649, -8.476, -20.347, -24.629, 19.850, -3.883, 4.695, -28.515). This prompted a shift in focus toward exploring narrower and more promising regions of interest—particularly around the successful configurations while avoiding known areas that consistently yielded lower outputs.

Throughout the process, the hypotheses gained refinement and specificity, with a shift towards verifying interactions in previously unexplored parameter subspaces. This culminated in a clearer understanding of which combinations were most effective at maximizing the target output.
