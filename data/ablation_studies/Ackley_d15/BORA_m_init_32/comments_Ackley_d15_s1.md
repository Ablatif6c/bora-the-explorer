## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to maximize a mathematical black-box function through Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will systematically explore a multidimensional parameter space defined by 15 input variables, ranging from \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of -30 to 20. This expansive range allows us to investigate a wide variety of potential configurations influencing the target function effectively.

Bayesian optimization is particularly suitable for this task, as it leverages a probabilistic model, typically a Gaussian Process, to predict the function's behavior across the defined parameter space. By selecting points that balance exploration (trying new areas) and exploitation (focusing on promising regions), BO will refine its predictions based on observed outputs from the black-box function.

As the optimization proceeds, I will monitor for plateaus in performance, indicating that the current parameter configurations may not yield further improvements. At such points, I can suggest adjustments based on historical data, hypothesis testing, or derivative-free optimization methods, guiding further exploration to identify settings that maximize the target function effectively. This systematic approach aims to converge to optimal solutions efficiently even in high-dimensional spaces.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initialization phase, we are generating diverse hypotheses to effectively explore the parameter space of the mathematical black-box function. The proposed hypotheses focus on sampling various regions, including central, extreme, and mixed value points, to capture a comprehensive range of potential behaviors. Points that target both high and low edges of the parameter space will help uncover critical interactions between parameters that could influence the target widely. Specifically, we have included mixed configurations that could reveal interesting synergies among parameters, as well as entirely symmetric configurations to assess the response of the function to equally varied inputs. This strategic approach is expected to enhance our understanding of the function landscape and identify promising areas where the target can be maximized.

## Iteration 37

As we progress into iteration 36 of our Bayesian Optimization, valuable insights have emerged from the experimental data thus far. The highest target observed is 9.303 from the first iteration (with all input variables set to 5.0). Since then, other configurations have yielded significantly lower targets, indicating that the center of the parameter space may trend towards optimal values. Configurations with extreme values, such as those towards -30 or 20 for multiple parameters, have consistently resulted in lower performance (notable examples can be seen in iterations 2 and 3), which suggests that pushing parameters to their boundaries often inhibits performance. Conversely, configurations blending positive and negative values or centered distributions may create beneficial interactions and improve target outcomes. This analysis suggests that we should focus on a refined exploration of the central and mixed configurations that previously showed promise. Therefore, moving forward, we will discard hypotheses relying on uniform extremes and instead prioritize points around the central values and selected mixed regions to maximize the outcome effectively.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Central Values Exploration

#### Centered Positive Tweaks

*Rationale:* Configurations near zero, incorporating slight negative adjustments, may uncover beneficial synergies around value zero.

*Confidence:* medium

## Iteration 72

As we reach iteration 71 of our Bayesian Optimization, significant patterns have emerged from the collected data. The highest target observed remains at 9.303 from the first iteration with all parameters set to 5.0, reinforcing the notion that configurations centered around this value are promising. Additionally, past iterations show that configurations with closely balanced variables and slight perturbations yield better performance, suggesting that blending both moderate positive and negative values leads to beneficial interactions. Conversely, extreme configurations, either entirely at the lower boundary (-30) or upper boundary (20), consistently perform poorly, demonstrating their detrimental effect in maximizing the target. Exploring variations near zero, while incorporating small adjustments, appears to enhance results consistently. Therefore, we will focus on refining our hypotheses: emphasizing exploration within central and balanced regions while discarding those testing extreme values, which have repeatedly resulted in low targets. This refined strategy aims to uncover novel beneficial interactions and maximize the outcome effectively.

### Updated Hypotheses

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on experimental findings and iterated performance data. Initially, diverse configurations were proposed, exploring both extremes and central values. However, as data accumulated, it became evident that extreme parameters consistently yielded poorer performance, with the highest target remaining at 9.303, achieved with all parameters set to 5.0.

In subsequent iterations, the focus shifted towards more centralized configurations, emphasizing balanced regions blending positive and negative values. Reflecting on the observed results, hypotheses began to highlight subtle positive and negative adjustments near zero to uncover potential beneficial interactions that had shown promise in previous trials. This led to refined hypotheses such as "Refined Central Exploration" and "Balanced Moderate Configuration," which resonated well with the data collected.

Hypotheses relying on extreme values or uniform configurations were gradually discarded. Instead, the optimization strategy honed in on areas around zero with slight deviations, promoting effective synergies. The evolution of hypotheses demonstrates a shift from broad explorations toward targeted refinements rooted in empirical observations, ultimately enhancing the chance of discovering optimal parameter settings.
