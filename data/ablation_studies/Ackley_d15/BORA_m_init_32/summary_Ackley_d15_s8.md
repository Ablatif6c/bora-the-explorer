# BORA for Target Maximization

## 1. Executive Summary

The optimization process utilizing Bayesian Optimization (BORA) successfully culminated in a maximum target output of 17.163. This result was achieved through a rigorous exploration of the parameter space defined by 15 input variables ranging from -30 to 20. The evolution of hypotheses centered on mid-range parameter values, particularly around zero, proved to be critical in identifying the optimal combinations for maximizing the target. Consistent refinement of hypotheses and the strategic focus on previously successful parameters led to a deeper understanding of the mathematical phenomena underpinning the black-box function.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:**  
The main objective of this optimization process was to identify parameter settings that would maximize a mathematical black-box function through a systematic exploration of input variables defined within specific bounds.

**Initial Hypotheses:**  
Initially, five hypotheses were generated to explore diverse regions of the parameter space:

1. **Mid-Range Exploration:** Targeting central values, hypothesizing favorable outcomes around the midpoint.
2. **Boundary Extremes:** Testing upper boundary limits to investigate potential higher target values.
3. **Lower Boundary Cluster:** Investigating extreme lower values to identify unique functional properties.
4. **Positive Gradient Search:** Exploring combinations of predominantly positive values to achieve higher outputs.
5. **Varied Positional Test:** Utilizing mixed positive and negative values to explore potential non-linear interactions.

Each hypothesis was based on assumptions regarding interactions and behaviors of the mathematical function, anticipating that certain combinations would yield better results than others.

## 3. Progress Summary

**Key Milestones:**  
The optimization process consisted of 105 iterations, during which hypotheses were reevaluated based on experimental insights. The table below summarizes the evolution of hypotheses through various iterations:

| Iteration | Confirmed Hypotheses                          | Discarded Hypotheses            | Refined Hypotheses                    |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1         | None                                          | None                             | Mid-Range Exploration                 |
| 37        | Mid-Range Exploration                         | Boundary Extremes                | Positivity Gradient Search             |
| 72        | Mid-Range Exploration                         | Lower Boundary Cluster           | Refined Mid-Range Exploration         |
| 105       | Closer to Zero Variability, Detrimental Input Reduction | Positive Gradient Search            | Optimistic Positive Gradient          |

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**  
Significant changes were made to the parameter subspaces during the optimization process. Early explorations involving extremes were quickly discarded in favor of mid-range values due to their favorable performance. For instance, the "Refined Mid-Range Exploration" hypothesis emerged from confirming previous iterations that highlighted the effectiveness of parameters around -3 and 0, which consistently produced higher targets. Consequently, parameters were adjusted to explore variations closer to zero, refining the search based on accumulated knowledge.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The optimization process highlighted key insights regarding performance outcomes related to varying parameter settings. The highest-performing sample was achieved during the final iterations with the input settings:

- **Best Sample:**  
  - \(x_0 = 0\),
  - \(x_1 = 1\),
  - \(x_2 = -1\),
  - \(x_3 = 2\),
  - \(x_4 = 0\),
  - \(x_5 = 1\),
  - \(x_6 = 0\),
  - \(x_7 = 2\),
  - \(x_8 = -1\),
  - \(x_9 = 2\),
  - \(x_{10} = 3\),
  - \(x_{11} = 1\),
  - \(x_{12} = 0\),
  - \(x_{13} = -1\),
  - \(x_{14} = 1\)  
  - Target Output: **17.163**

Conversely, the worst samples involved extreme negative inputs leading to plateaued functional output:

- **Worst Sample:**  
  - \(x_0 = -30\),
  - \(x_1 = -30\),
  - \(x_2 = -30\),
  - \(x_3 = -30\),
  - \(x_4 = -30\),
  - \(x_5 = -30\),
  - \(x_6 = -30\),
  - \(x_7 = -30\),
  - \(x_8 = -30\),
  - \(x_9 = -30\),
  - \(x_{10} = -30\),
  - \(x_{11} = -30\),
  - \(x_{12} = -30\),
  - \(x_{13} = -30\),
  - \(x_{14} = -30\)  
  - Target Output: **1.995**

The findings align with established mathematical principles, indicating that functions may exhibit higher sensitivity to changes in input around balanced regions, supporting hypotheses regarding non-linear interactions. The experimental data revealed that exploring combinations of moderate parameters avoids the detrimental effects observed at the extreme ends of the defined parameter space.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

To enhance the efficacy of future optimization experiments, several recommendations are proposed:

1. **Expanded Parameter Ranges:** Future studies might benefit from expanding the bounds of parameters or introducing additional dimensions to further probe interaction effects.
2. **Parallel Exploration:** Implementing parallel strategies for exploring multiple hypotheses simultaneously could accelerate discoveries by quickly identifying successful regions.
3. **Incorporation of Machine Learning Approaches:** Integrating machine learning models to predict parameter interactions based on previous outcomes may refine the understanding of the underlying function dynamics.
4. **Adaptive Sampling Techniques:** Employing adaptive sampling methods that dynamically refine the search space based on the output of prior iterations could lead to more efficient exploration of promising areas.

## 6. Conclusion

In conclusion, the optimization process via BORA successfully identified optimal parameter settings that maximized the target output of 17.163. The iterative refinement of hypotheses, evolving from broadly exploratory initial assumptions to narrowly targeted min-max strategies around mid-range values, significantly contributed to this success. Key learnings emphasize the effectiveness of systematic parameter exploration and the vital role of refining hypotheses based on empirical results. These findings lay a robust foundation for future mathematical explorations, promising deeper insights into non-linear dynamics and function behaviors. As such, they hold relevance not only for optimization endeavors but also for the further development of theories in mathematical optimization practices.
