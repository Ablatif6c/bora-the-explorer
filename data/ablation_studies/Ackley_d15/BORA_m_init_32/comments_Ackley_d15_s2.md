## Experiment Overview

The experiment aims to optimize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The goal is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a designated target output, leveraging a total of 15 input variables (x_0 to x_14), each constrained within the bounds of -30 to 20. With such a high-dimensional parameter space, the challenge lies in efficiently exploring this range to uncover the maximum.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically sample the parameter space, relying on a probabilistic model—usually a Gaussian Process (GP)—to predict the output based on prior observations. This model will inform which areas of the space to explore next by incorporating both the predicted mean output and uncertainty estimates, thereby balancing exploration and exploitation.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor for plateaus in performance where incremental adjustments yield insufficient improvements. In such cases, I will suggest alternative sampling strategies, such as adjusting the priors or utilizing different acquisition functions, to refresh exploration and potentially identify novel maxima. Ultimately, we aim to map the highest achievable target values within the given constraints, thus gaining insights into the underlying behavior of the black-box function.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we strategically selected diverse hypotheses to explore the parameter space for maximizing the target output of the black-box function. The chosen points thoughtfully cover the boundaries as well as the central regions, incorporating combinations of positive and negative values to capture potential interactions. These selections range from extreme values, which test the limits of the function, to mixed values that might reveal nonlinear behaviors and interactions among parameters. By examining central, edge, and mixed points, we aim to discover fundamental properties of the function while efficiently informing the Bayesian Optimization process. This exploration is crucial for identifying regions that yield high performance, thereby steering subsequent iterations of optimization effectively.

## Iteration 37

As of iteration 36, the dataset reveals a maximum target value of 21.945, observed during the first experiment when all parameters were set to zero. This serves as the established high-water mark for subsequent points tested. For the upcoming hypotheses, I selected suggestions from the optimizer to explore both regions characterized by extreme negative values and those with a balance of high positive values among certain dimensions. The first hypothesis incorporates a mix of negative and positive values, which aims to explore regions displayed under previous conditions that may reveal further intricate interactions in the output. The second hypothesis focuses on high positive domain values combined with a few negative parameters, potentially unlocking additional performance insights, given the function's behavior has shown higher outputs near zero or in specific positive combinations. Together, these hypotheses focus on both exploring uncharted territories and refining promising areas to maximize the target output effectively through Bayesian Optimization.

### Updated Hypotheses

## Iteration 75

At iteration 74, the data reveals that the highest target value across the experiments remains 21.945, achieved with all parameters set to zero. Subsequent points have generally yielded outputs around 1-7, with no new maxima observed. In this iteration, I propose two hypotheses based on optimizer suggestions aimed at exploring diverse domains of the parameter space. The first hypothesis incorporates a blend of significant negative and positive values, which may reveal complex interactions that could influence output dynamics, particularly focusing on how extreme values interact with moderate ones. The second hypothesis seeks to balance certain negative conditions with a configuration of modest positives, hypothesizing that this mid-range exploration could unlock previously unseen behaviors in the function. Collectively, these hypotheses are designed to maximize the likelihood of discovering higher target values by comprehensively probing the black-box function's intricate response landscape.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization experiment, the hypotheses evolved significantly as new data was collected and insights were gained. Initially, the focus was on exploring diverse regions of the parameter space, including both negative and positive configurations. The first hypotheses were designed to cover central points and edge cases, which aimed to provide broad coverage of the function's landscape.

As iterations progressed, the experimental data revealed a high-water mark of 21.945, established with all parameters set to zero. Subsequent hypotheses were adjusted in consideration of the outputs observed around this maximum. The selection of hypotheses began to prioritize areas that had previously shown promising results, such as configurations that combined moderate positive and significant negative values.

Over time, hypotheses aimed to refine the search strategy, especially in areas where the output remained underwhelming. The goal shifted to investigating intricate interactions among parameters that could influence performance, leading to hypotheses that blended values more thoughtfully based on empirical findings.

The following table summarizes the evolution of confidence in the hypotheses across the optimization iterations:
