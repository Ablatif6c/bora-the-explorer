## Experiment Overview

This experiment aims to identify the optimal parameter settings for a mathematical black-box function, maximizing a defined target using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization task is structured around 15 input variables, labeled \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within a common range of (-30, 20). This uniform boundary allows for a systematic exploration of a high-dimensional space while ensuring all parameter settings remain feasible.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed as a probabilistic model to guide the search process. Initially, a surrogate model, such as a Gaussian Process, will be fit to the observed data, reflecting the known values of the black-box function. This model will facilitate the estimation of function values at untested points, effectively balancing exploration (searching broadly) and exploitation (refining known good areas).

As the optimization progresses, point suggestions will be made whenever the BO model plateaus, indicating limited improvement. Potential conditions maximizing the target will be identified by analyzing where responses peak concerning the parameter settings. Given the complexity of the parameter landscape, analyzing interactions among variables will be crucial in steering subsequent exploratory efforts, ultimately enhancing the likelihood of discovering optimal configurations efficiently.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, we have designed five diverse hypotheses focused on maximizing the target function by systematically exploring different regions of the parameter space. Each point is strategically chosen to cover a range of values from extreme bounds to centered configurations. By analyzing expected relationships and parameter interactions, we aim to uncover potential maxima. The hypotheses range from exploring extremes, both positive and negative, to assessing balanced combinations that could reveal correlations within the black-box function. Exploring both central tendencies and outlier points helps establish a foundational understanding of the target function's behavior. Employing these hypotheses will inform our Bayesian Optimization model, allowing for agile adjustments and further sampling based on observed results, which may lead to enhanced targeting of optimal parameter settings.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -30.0, 'x_1': 20.0, 'x_2': -30.0, 'x_3': 20.0, 'x_4': -30.0, 'x_5': 20.0, 'x_6': -30.0, 'x_7': 20.0, 'x_8': -30.0, 'x_9': 20.0, 'x_10': -30.0, 'x_11': 20.0, 'x_12': -30.0, 'x_13': 20.0, 'x_14': -30.0}

## Iteration 37

As we reach iteration 36, a comprehensive assessment of the data reveals that the maximum observed target value so far is 9.990, achieved at the configuration (4.033, -11.744, -2.773, -1.872, 4.635, -8.772, -0.855, 12.235, -1.090, -6.495, 0.938, -6.955, 5.766, -1.444, 9.990). This indicates that configurations around moderate positive values for certain parameters, particularly (x_0) and (x_4), yield significantly higher outputs, while maintaining neutrality or slight negativity across others. The earlier hypothesis focusing entirely on high extremes has proven detrimental, generating lower target values, as with configurations deeply skewed towards -30 across the parameters. Contrastingly, the mid-range approaches have produced promising results around (x_0 approx 4.0) and (x_1 approx -11.0). Moving forward, an amalgamation of insights highlights the importance of exploring balanced configurations that blend moderate positive and strategic low values, which have the potential to unlock further maxima. Below are the refined hypotheses, aligned with the latest findings and the observed performance patterns.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 10.0, 'x_1': -1.0, 'x_2': 5.0, 'x_3': 10.0, 'x_4': 1.0, 'x_5': 7.0, 'x_6': -1.0, 'x_7': 5.0, 'x_8': 0.0, 'x_9': -1.0, 'x_10': 8.0, 'x_11': 3.0, 'x_12': 5.0, 'x_13': 7.0, 'x_14': 4.0}

#### Mixed Boundary Exploration

*Rationale:* To investigate the combined influences of both low and high extreme values which may expose hidden nonlinear behaviors in the target function.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 18.0, 'x_1': -19.0, 'x_2': 1.0, 'x_3': -18.0, 'x_4': 10.0, 'x_5': 8.0, 'x_6': 3.0, 'x_7': 20.0, 'x_8': -15.0, 'x_9': -3.0, 'x_10': -12.0, 'x_11': 14.0, 'x_12': 8.0, 'x_13': -5.0, 'x_14': -30.0}

## Iteration 72

As we reach iteration 71, the experimental data reveals significant insights into parameter interactions with respect to maximizing the target function. The highest observed target value to date is 12.030, achieved at the configuration (2.0, 3.0, -1.0, 5.0, -2.0, 7.0, -3.0, 6.0, 0.0, 4.0, 1.0, -1.0, 2.0, 0.5, 0.0). This suggests that configurations emphasizing moderate positive values across several parameters, particularly near values like (x_0 = 2.0), (x_1 = 3.0), and (x_5 = 7.0), are instrumental in achieving higher outputs. Conversely, configurations heavily skewed towards extreme negative values yielded lower target outcomes, underlining the detrimental nature of such extremes. Beyond this, symmetric configurations around zero have also shown promise, with specific set-ups yielding substantial gains. Moving forward, the focus will be on further refining our strategies towards balanced and zero-centered explorations while also examining slightly varied positive ranges for potential local maxima. The subspaces that yield the best results cluster around moderate positive values combined with strategically placed slight negative values, while those heavily skewed towards negative extremes remain detrimental. The following hypotheses have been formulated to explore these promising configurations further.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, our hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gleaned from experimental data and observed target values. Initially, the hypotheses focused on extreme values, mid-range simplicity, and combinations. However, as we gathered more data, it became clear that configurations leaning towards moderate positive values yielded significantly higher targets, particularly with combinations around \(x_0\), \(x_1\), and \(x_5\).

In iteration 37, hypotheses began to reflect this understanding by emphasizing balanced and zero-centered configurations. This change was driven by the realization that near-neutral values alongside select positive values facilitated stronger outcomes. By iteration 72, our hypotheses further adapted to incorporate focused positive ranges and refined zero-centered combinations, revealing patterns of interaction that maximized performance.

Emerging from our findings was the recognition that excessive negativity tended to suppress performance, while moderate configurations enhanced synergy effects. Consequently, the latter hypotheses aimed to probe deeper into these identified peaks with minor adaptations around successful points.
