# BORA for Target Maximization

## 1. Executive Summary

This optimization process aimed to identify the parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function, ultimately achieving a maximum target value of 10.284. Key insights from the experimentation indicated varying degrees of parameter effectiveness, with specific combinations of mid-range and extreme values yielding the best results. Several initial hypotheses were refined throughout the optimization stages, highlighting the need for a balanced exploration and exploitation strategy within the parameter space.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:** The main goal of this optimization was to find the parameter settings that maximize the output of a mathematical black-box function defined across 15 continuous input variables, each constrained between -30 and 20. The optimization aimed to identify the optimal configurations that would yield the highest possible target value.

**Initial Hypotheses:** Five hypotheses were proposed prior to the optimization:

1. **Max Positive Edge:** This hypothesis sought maximum target value through extreme positive values across all parameters. The rationale was based on the assumption that high input values would often lead to higher outputs.
   
2. **Balanced Midpoint:** This hypothesis focused on a diverse set of mid-range values, hypothesizing that combinations might reveal hidden relationships among parameters, leading to unexpected synergies.
   
3. **Negative Exploration:** This point investigated the lower limits of the parameter bounds, testing whether undesirable or negative settings might yield surprisingly beneficial interactions.
   
4. **Diverse Spread:** This hypothesis aimed to cover different regions of the parameter space by accessing highly heterogeneous combinations that could reveal complex dependencies.
   
5. **Corner Combination:** This hypothesis proposed exploring extreme combinations of negative and positive values from corners of the parameter space, assuming that such combinations might uncover unique behavior of the target function.

## 3. Progress Summary

**Key Milestones:** The table below summarizes the evolution of the hypotheses through the iterations, marking the response and adjustments made at each stage.

| Iteration | Hypothesis            | Status         | Rationale for Status Change                              |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Max Positive Edge     | Discarded      | Target maximum was not achieved; too rigid with values.  |
| 2         | Balanced Midpoint     | Confirmed      | Showed significant increases in target, gaining confidence. |
| 3         | Negative Exploration   | Refined        | Results indicated lower negative limits yielded benefits.  |
| 4         | Diverse Spread        | Confirmed      | Consistently provided varied performance across evaluations. |
| 5         | Corner Combination     | Discarded      | Results showed no significant advantage; combinations were ineffective. |
| 10–20     | Re-evaluation         | Continuous     | Iterative adjustments based on acquired data; emphasis shifted to positive-negative interactions and central estimates. |
| 60        | Best Achieved Sample  | Final          | Parameters: `(-1.651, -3.386, 0.012, 1.173, -1.685, -3.424, -2.729, -4.734, -0.401, -3.759, 3.785, -1.960, 1.395, 8.472, 0.445)` delivering target of 10.284. |

**Major Parameter Adjustments:** Throughout the optimization, several influences led to substantial changes in explored parameter subspaces. Notably, emphasis shifted from extremes in the "Max Positive Edge" hypothesis towards a hybrid strategy derived from the "Balanced Midpoint" and "Diverse Spread" hypotheses. Adjustments encompassed widening the search space to encompass combinations that included potential synergies between both negative and positive parameters.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The best-performing set of parameters was identified as:

- **Best Sample:** `(-1.651, -3.386, 0.012, 1.173, -1.685, -3.424, -2.729, -4.734, -0.401, -3.759, 3.785, -1.960, 1.395, 8.472, 0.445)` with a maximum target value of **10.284**.

Conversely, the worst-performing set:

- **Worst Sample:** `(20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000, 20.000)` achieved only **2.312**.

The optimization results highlighted non-linear relationships among various parameters that were not initially anticipated. For example, combinations involving minor negative adjustments accompanied by varying mid-range values of other inputs led to significant improvements in target outcome, illustrating the complexity of the function.

Unexpected findings emerged, confirming the flexibility of values beyond simple extremities, emphasizing a need for a more nuanced understanding of mathematical phenomena regarding interaction effects.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the current experiment’s findings, several recommendations for future studies can be proposed:

1. **Incorporate a Wider Range of Values:** Future experiments should consider extending the parameters' bounds beyond -30 to 20. This expanded range may capture more complex behaviors in the target function.

2. **Testing Non-linear Interactions:** Further investigations into potential quadratic or polynomial relationships could unveil deeper insights into the dependency structures among inputs.

3. **Utilize Advanced Bayesian Techniques:** Exploring adaptive Bayesian Optimization methods such as multi-fidelity approaches may yield an efficient search process and accelerate convergence.

4. **Incorporate More Diverse Initial Samples:** Future optimizations could benefit from increased diversity in initial sampling strategies, ensuring broader coverage of the parameter space from the outset.

## 6. Conclusion

The optimization process yielded valuable insights, confirming that mid-range diverse combinations can significantly enhance output where extreme parameter values do not. The hypotheses were continually refined, allowing for a deeper understanding of parameter interactions with the ultimate achievement of a maximum target value of 10.284. 

These findings support future mathematics experiments by emphasizing the importance of flexible exploration tactics and the necessity for adaptive optimization strategies. In closing, the lessons learned from this study reinforce the principle that mathematical functions are often more intricate than initially perceived, necessitating continued exploration to unlock their full potential.
