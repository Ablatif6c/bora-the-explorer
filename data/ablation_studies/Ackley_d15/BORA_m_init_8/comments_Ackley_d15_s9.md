## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). This extensive parameter space allows for a diverse exploration of potential configurations, which is crucial for uncovering the function's maximum.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this high-dimensional space. BO utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the function's behavior and guide the search for optimal parameters. Initially, a set of random points will be sampled to build a surrogate model, which will then be used to suggest new points for evaluation based on the expected improvement over the current best-known result.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance and suggest new points when the BO process plateaus, indicating that the search may be converging. By identifying conditions that maximize the target function, we aim to efficiently navigate the parameter space, ultimately leading to the discovery of the optimal settings that yield the highest function value. This approach balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring a thorough investigation of the parameter landscape.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses generated focus on different combinations of parameters, considering potential interactions and expected behaviors. By strategically selecting points across the entire range, we can maximize the likelihood of discovering promising regions that lead to higher function values. The hypotheses include exploring extreme values at both ends of the parameter range, which may reveal non-linear behaviors, as well as sampling the center to establish a baseline. Additionally, a balanced midpoint configuration is proposed to identify interactions among parameters, while a diverse random sampling approach aims to capture variability and unexpected peaks. This comprehensive exploration strategy is designed to efficiently navigate the parameter space and identify conditions that maximize the target function.
### Initial Hypotheses

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 20, 'x_1': 20, 'x_2': 20, 'x_3': 20, 'x_4': 20, 'x_5': 20, 'x_6': 20, 'x_7': 20, 'x_8': 20, 'x_9': 20, 'x_10': 20, 'x_11': 20, 'x_12': 20, 'x_13': 20, 'x_14': 20}

## Iteration 14

As we progress through iteration 13 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest target value observed is 21.945 at iteration 4, where all parameters were set to zero. This suggests that the central region of the parameter space may be particularly promising. Additionally, the second highest target value of 15.901 was recorded at iteration 9, indicating that a combination of parameters around zero can yield favorable results. Conversely, extreme values, such as those in iterations 1 and 3, have consistently resulted in lower target values, suggesting that the boundaries of the parameter space may be detrimental.     The subspace around (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) appears to maximize the target, while extreme negative and positive values tend to minimize it. Given these findings, I propose refining our hypotheses to focus on the central region and explore slight variations around the previously successful points. The previous hypotheses that explored extreme values will be discarded, as they have not yielded promising results. Instead, I will suggest new points that maintain proximity to the successful configurations while introducing slight perturbations to explore the surrounding space. This approach aims to efficiently navigate the parameter space and identify conditions that maximize the target function.

## Iteration 30

As we reach iteration 29 of the Bayesian Optimization process, we have gathered a wealth of data that provides critical insights into the behavior of the target function. The highest target value observed is 21.945 from iteration 4, where all parameters were set to zero, indicating that the central region of the parameter space is indeed promising. The second highest value of 18.320 was recorded at iteration 16 with slight negative perturbations, suggesting that exploring variations around zero can yield beneficial results. Conversely, extreme values, particularly those observed in iterations 1 and 3, have consistently resulted in lower target values, reinforcing the notion that the boundaries of the parameter space are detrimental.     The subspace around (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) continues to maximize the target, while configurations with extreme negative or positive values tend to minimize it. Given these findings, I propose refining our hypotheses to focus on slight variations around the successful central point and exploring combinations that maintain proximity to this region. I will discard hypotheses that have not yielded promising results and introduce new ones that explore the central area more thoroughly. The next hypotheses will include slight perturbations around zero, slightly positive values, and balanced configurations to capture potential interactions that may lead to higher targets.

Additionally, a notable target value of 18.320 was achieved at iteration 16 with slight negative perturbations, indicating that exploring variations around zero can yield beneficial results. Conversely, extreme values, particularly those observed in iterations 1 and 3, have consistently resulted in lower target values, indicating that the boundaries of the parameter space are detrimental. The subspace around (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) continues to maximize the target, while configurations with extreme negative or positive values tend to minimize it.

Conversely, extreme values, particularly those observed in iterations 1 and 3, have consistently resulted in lower target values, indicating that the boundaries of the parameter space are detrimental. The subspace around (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) continues to maximize the target, while configurations with extreme negative or positive values tend to minimize it. Given these findings, I propose refining our hypotheses to focus on slight variations around the successful central point and exploring combinations that maintain proximity to this region. I will discard hypotheses that have not yielded promising results and introduce new ones that explore the central area more thoroughly, including slight perturbations around zero and balanced configurations to capture potential interactions that may lead to higher targets.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Central Point Refinement

*Rationale:* Building on the success of the central point, this hypothesis explores a refined point around zero to identify optimal configurations.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 0.6, 'x_1': 0.6, 'x_2': 0.6, 'x_3': 0.6, 'x_4': 0.6, 'x_5': 0.6, 'x_6': 0.6, 'x_7': 0.6, 'x_8': 0.6, 'x_9': 0.6, 'x_10': 0.6, 'x_11': 0.6, 'x_12': 0.6, 'x_13': 0.6, 'x_14': 0.6}

#### Exploration of Mixed Values

*Rationale:* A diverse combination of values may help capture the function's variability and identify unexpected peaks.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -1, 'x_1': 1, 'x_2': 0, 'x_3': 2, 'x_4': -2, 'x_5': 3, 'x_6': -1, 'x_7': 1, 'x_8': 0, 'x_9': -2, 'x_10': 2, 'x_11': 0, 'x_12': 1, 'x_13': -1, 'x_14': 2}

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the Bayesian Optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the hypotheses focused on exploring extreme values and diverse random configurations across the parameter space. However, as the iterations progressed, it became evident that the central region of the parameter space yielded the highest target values, particularly the configuration where all parameters were set to zero, which achieved a target of 21.945.

In response to these findings, the hypotheses shifted towards refining points around the successful central configuration. Subsequent iterations emphasized slight perturbations around zero and combinations of positive and negative values to explore potential interactions that could lead to higher targets. The focus on extreme values was largely abandoned, as they consistently resulted in lower target values.

The confidence in the hypotheses also evolved, reflecting the increasing understanding of the parameter space. Initially, confidence was moderate for diverse explorations, but as successful configurations were identified, confidence in hypotheses targeting the central region increased to high.
