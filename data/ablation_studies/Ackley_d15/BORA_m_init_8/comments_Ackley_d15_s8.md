## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). This extensive parameter space allows for a diverse exploration of potential configurations, which is crucial for uncovering the function's maximum.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this high-dimensional space. Initially, a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process, will be constructed based on a limited number of sampled points. This model will predict the function's behavior and uncertainty, guiding the selection of new points to evaluate. As the optimization progresses, BO will adaptively refine its search based on observed outcomes, balancing exploration of untested areas with exploitation of known high-performing regions.

When the optimization process plateaus—indicating diminishing returns from further evaluations—I will suggest new points to sample based on the surrogate model's predictions. This iterative approach aims to identify conditions that maximize the target function efficiently, ultimately leading to the best parameter settings within the defined constraints.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses generated focus on different combinations of parameters, considering potential interactions and promising regions. By sampling these points, we can better understand the function's landscape and identify areas that may lead to higher target values. The selected points are strategically chosen to cover a range of values across the defined bounds, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the parameter space. The hypotheses include high positive explorations, balanced midpoints, negative extremes, diverse random sampling, and edge case explorations. Each hypothesis is designed to capture different behaviors of the function, from potential nonlinearities in the upper bounds to interesting behaviors at the lower bounds. This approach will help us identify conditions that maximize the target effectively.

## Iteration 14

As we continue to refine our hypotheses based on the insights gained from the previous iterations, we have identified promising regions of the parameter space that warrant further exploration. The highest target value observed remains at 4.058, achieved with balanced midpoint values. This reinforces the idea that exploring around the center of the parameter space is beneficial. Additionally, the combination of positive values has shown potential, suggesting that interactions among positive parameters may lead to higher outputs. The zero-centered exploration hypothesis is also crucial, as it targets a balanced approach that could yield favorable results. The diverse positive and negative mix hypothesis aims to capture interactions that may not be evident when only focusing on one side of the parameter space. Lastly, the edge case exploration will now include new points to investigate the effects of extreme values without duplicating previous samples. This comprehensive approach will help us identify the optimal parameter settings effectively.

## Iteration 42

As we progress through iteration 41, the data reveals several insights into the optimization landscape. The highest target value observed is 21.945, achieved with the zero-centered exploration hypothesis, indicating that balanced parameter settings around zero may yield optimal results. The refined midpoint exploration also performed well, suggesting that exploring near the center of the parameter space is beneficial. Conversely, extreme negative values, particularly in the edge case explorations, have consistently resulted in lower target values, indicating that these regions may be detrimental to performance. The positive value exploration hypothesis has shown promise, but it may need to be adjusted to incorporate more diversity in the positive range. Moving forward, I propose refining our hypotheses to focus on the successful regions while discarding those that have not yielded favorable results. New hypotheses will target specific combinations of parameters that have shown potential based on the data collected so far. The exploration of diverse positive and negative mixes may also reveal interactions that lead to higher targets. Overall, the focus will be on balanced and diverse parameter settings to maximize the target effectively.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring diverse regions of the parameter space, including extreme values and balanced midpoints. However, as iterations progressed, it became evident that certain regions yielded consistently higher target values, particularly around zero and moderate positive values.

The refined zero-centered exploration hypothesis emerged as a standout performer, achieving the highest target value of 21.945. This prompted a shift in focus towards more balanced parameter settings, as they appeared to facilitate favorable interactions among parameters. The diverse positive exploration hypothesis was also adjusted to incorporate a wider range of positive values, reflecting the need for capturing potential interactions that could enhance performance.

Conversely, hypotheses targeting extreme negative values were largely discarded due to their consistently lower performance. The exploration of positive and negative mixes was retained but refined to avoid extremes, emphasizing the importance of careful selection of values.

Overall, the evolution of hypotheses was driven by a data-informed approach, prioritizing successful regions while discarding less effective strategies. This iterative refinement allowed for a more targeted exploration of the parameter space, ultimately leading to improved outcomes.
