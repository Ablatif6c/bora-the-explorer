## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization process will focus on 15 input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of (-30, 20). This extensive parameter space allows for a diverse exploration of potential configurations, which is crucial for uncovering the function's maximum.

Bayesian Optimization will be employed to systematically explore this high-dimensional space. BO utilizes a probabilistic model to predict the function's behavior and guide the search for optimal parameters. Initially, a set of random points will be sampled to build a surrogate model, which will then be used to suggest new points for evaluation based on the expected improvement over the current best-known result.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor the performance and suggest new points when the BO process plateaus, indicating that the search may be converging or stagnating. By identifying conditions that maximize the target function, we aim to efficiently navigate the parameter space, ultimately leading to the discovery of the optimal settings that yield the highest function value. This approach balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring a thorough investigation of the parameter landscape.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we aim to explore diverse regions of the parameter space to gather valuable information about the black-box function. The hypotheses are designed to cover a range of values, including both extremes and midpoints, to capture potential nonlinear relationships among parameters. By strategically selecting these points, we can enhance our understanding of the function's behavior and identify promising areas for further exploration. The hypotheses include sampling at the midpoints to reveal central tendencies, extreme negative and positive values to uncover unexpected behaviors, a balanced mix of values to explore interactions, and a randomized point to capture any anomalies. This comprehensive approach will allow us to effectively navigate the parameter space and identify conditions that maximize the target function.
### Initial Hypotheses

#### Midpoint Exploration

*Rationale:* Sampling around the midpoint of the parameter bounds may reveal a central tendency in the function's behavior.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -5, 'x_1': 0, 'x_2': 5, 'x_3': -10, 'x_4': 10, 'x_5': -15, 'x_6': 0, 'x_7': 5, 'x_8': -5, 'x_9': 10, 'x_10': -10, 'x_11': 0, 'x_12': 5, 'x_13': -5, 'x_14': 0}

#### Extreme Negative Values

*Rationale:* Exploring extreme negative values may uncover regions where the function behaves unexpectedly or has local maxima.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -30, 'x_1': -30, 'x_2': -30, 'x_3': -30, 'x_4': -30, 'x_5': -30, 'x_6': -30, 'x_7': -30, 'x_8': -30, 'x_9': -30, 'x_10': -30, 'x_11': -30, 'x_12': -30, 'x_13': -30, 'x_14': -30}

#### Extreme Positive Values

*Rationale:* Sampling extreme positive values may help identify the function's behavior at the upper bounds.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 20, 'x_1': 20, 'x_2': 20, 'x_3': 20, 'x_4': 20, 'x_5': 20, 'x_6': 20, 'x_7': 20, 'x_8': 20, 'x_9': 20, 'x_10': 20, 'x_11': 20, 'x_12': 20, 'x_13': 20, 'x_14': 20}

#### Balanced Mixed Values

*Rationale:* A balanced mix of positive and negative values may reveal interactions between parameters that affect the target function.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -10, 'x_1': 10, 'x_2': -5, 'x_3': 5, 'x_4': 0, 'x_5': -15, 'x_6': 10, 'x_7': -10, 'x_8': 5, 'x_9': 0, 'x_10': -20, 'x_11': 15, 'x_12': -5, 'x_13': 10, 'x_14': -10}

#### Randomized Exploration

*Rationale:* Randomly sampling within the bounds can help uncover unexpected behaviors in the function.

*Confidence:* low

*Points:*

- {'x_0': -12.5, 'x_1': 7.3, 'x_2': -18.2, 'x_3': 3.4, 'x_4': 15.1, 'x_5': -6.7, 'x_6': -25.0, 'x_7': 10.0, 'x_8': -1.5, 'x_9': 8.8, 'x_10': -14.4, 'x_11': 2.2, 'x_12': -9.9, 'x_13': 4.6, 'x_14': -3.3}

## Iteration 14

As we progress through iteration 13 of the Bayesian Optimization, we have gathered valuable insights from the experimental data. The highest target value observed is 6.203 at iteration 10, with a combination of parameters that includes moderate values for (x_0), (x_1), and (x_4). This suggests that the region around these values may be promising for further exploration. Conversely, extreme values, particularly those at the boundaries like -30 or 20, have generally resulted in lower target values, indicating that these subspaces are likely detrimental. The data also shows that combinations of negative and positive values can yield varying results, with some configurations leading to better outcomes than others.     Moving forward, I propose refining our hypotheses based on these observations. The previous hypotheses that focused solely on extreme values or random sampling have not yielded high target values and can be discarded. Instead, we will focus on mid-range values and combinations that have shown potential. The new hypotheses will target the promising regions identified in the data while also exploring slightly adjusted configurations to maximize the target function. Specifically, we will explore values around the previously successful parameters and combinations that have yielded higher target values, while also considering balanced mixes of positive and negative values.

This reinforces the idea that configurations around the center of the parameter space, particularly those that incorporate both positive and negative values, are promising. The exploration of previously successful combinations has also shown potential, indicating that refining these configurations could lead to further improvements.

## Iteration 100

As we continue to refine our hypotheses based on the insights gained from previous iterations, we will focus on exploring new points that maintain the promising characteristics of the central region while avoiding previously evaluated configurations. The data indicates that configurations around the center of the parameter space, particularly those that incorporate both positive and negative values, yield better results. The highest target value observed remains at 21.945, achieved with all parameters set to zero, while a balanced mix of values has also shown potential. Moving forward, the new hypotheses will target slightly adjusted values around previously successful configurations, ensuring that we explore diverse regions of the parameter space effectively. This strategic approach aims to maximize the target function by leveraging the insights gained from past iterations.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the hypotheses evolved significantly based on the insights gained from experimental data. Initially, the hypotheses focused on exploring a wide range of values, including extreme boundaries and random configurations. However, as iterations progressed, it became clear that configurations around the center of the parameter space, particularly those incorporating both positive and negative values, yielded better results. 

The highest target value observed was consistently achieved with parameters set close to zero, prompting a shift towards refining hypotheses that targeted central values and slight adjustments around previously successful configurations. This strategic focus allowed for a more systematic exploration of promising regions, leading to improved target values.

As the optimization advanced, hypotheses were discarded if they did not yield high target values, while those that showed potential were refined and adjusted. The emphasis shifted towards balanced mixes of values and slight variations of successful combinations, enhancing the likelihood of discovering optimal configurations.

The following table summarizes the evolution of confidence in the hypotheses throughout the optimization process:

| Hypothesis Name                          | Initial Confidence | Final Confidence |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Midpoint Exploration                     | Medium             | High             |
| Extreme Negative Values                  | Medium             | Low              |
| Extreme Positive Values                  | Medium             | Low              |
| Balanced Mixed Values                    | High               | Medium           |
| Exploration of Previously Successful Comb.| High               | High             |
| Central Value Exploration                 | Medium             | High             |
| Slightly Adjusted Central Values         | High               | High             |
