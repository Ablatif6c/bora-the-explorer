# BORA for Target Maximization 

## 1. Executive Summary

The Bayesian Optimization (BO) process for maximizing the target function achieved a maximum output of 14.664 through systematic exploration of the parameter space. Initial hypotheses focused on broad ranges and mixed value configurations, but the most effective parameters evolved towards a balance of mild negative and moderate positive values. This evolution reflects the complex nature of the optimization landscape and highlights the need for careful parameter management in achieving optimal outcomes.

## 2. Optimization Overview

**Objective:** The primary goal of this optimization process was to find the set of parameters that maximized a mathematical black-box function, characterized by 15 input variables, each constrained within a range of (-30, 20).

**Initial Hypotheses:** 
1. **Mid-Range Balanced Exploration:** This hypothesis aimed at balancing negative and positive inputs, reasoning that mid-range values could harness potential peaks in the function.
2. **Lower Bound Exploration with Variation:** This hypothesis sought to explore lower boundary parameter settings mixed with mid-range variations, aiming to uncover effective patterns that contributed to higher target outputs.
3. **Positive Mixed Exploration:** By integrating strong positive values with selected negative inputs, this hypothesis was based on the assumption that peaks within the landscape might arise from oscillating valence configurations.
4. **Focused Exploration Around Previous Peaks:** This hypothesis aimed to fine-tune searches near known high-performing parameter configurations, exploiting local maxima identified in prior evaluations.

These initial hypotheses relied on the understanding that balance and proximity to known successful configurations could lead to better function evaluation outcomes.

## 3. Progress Summary

**Key Milestones:**

| Iteration | Key Findings and Evolution                               |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Initial configurations tested. Extreme values performed poorly (low target). |
| 22        | Mid-range explorations yielded promising results, confirming effectiveness of balanced configurations. |
| 41        | Maximum target of 13.669 reached; results validated earlier proofs of concept regarding effective midpoint configurations. |
| 60        | Incremental adjustments near midpoints confirmed and refined performance trends led to final top result of 14.664. |
| 81        | Sustained performance in mid-range configurations solidified hypothesis success based on observed outcomes. |

**Hypothesis Evolution:**
- **Mid-Range Balanced Exploration:** Initially high confidence, it evolved to a central role as data reaffirmed the importance of mid-range balancing.
- **Lower Bound Exploration with Variation:** Retained medium confidence but was refined as less impactful than first assumed.
- **Positive Mixed Exploration:** Continued medium confidence as variations consistently produced moderate results without peaks.
- **Focused Exploration Around Previous Peaks:** Maintained high confidence throughout for repeatability near previously successful outputs.

**Major Parameter Adjustments:**
Shifts predominantly occurred in near-boundary explorations, where data indicated diminishing returns. The algorithm's iterative refinements allowed for concentrating explorative efforts in the mid-range where previous successes had been observed, steering away from extremes that yielded consistently poor results.

## 4. Results and Key Insights

The highest-performing configuration was identified from iteration 41 and yielded a remarkable target of 14.664, accomplished with the following parameters:

- \( x_0 = -1.0 \)
- \( x_1 = -0.5 \)
- \( x_2 = 6.0 \)
- \( x_3 = -5.0 \)
- \( x_4 = 3.0 \)
- \( x_5 = -1.0 \)
- \( x_6 = 1.0 \)
- \( x_7 = -3.0 \)
- \( x_8 = 3.0 \)
- \( x_9 = 0.0 \)
- \( x_{10} = 1.0 \)
- \( x_{11} = 2.0 \)
- \( x_{12} = 5.0 \)
- \( x_{13} = 4.0 \)
- \( x_{14} = -2.0 \)

Conversely, the worst performance was at iteration 1, where all parameters were set to the lower bound (-30), yielding a target of only 1.995. 

The results corroborate the hypothesis that certain parameter combinations produce distinct outputs, suggesting the function may exhibit properties of local minima and maxima, consistent with known mathematical behavior in optimization landscapes. This finding underlines the importance of approaching the problem through balanced configurations to uncover optimal regions that demonstrate substantially superior outputs.

## 5. Recommendations for Future Experiments

Based on the findings, the following recommendations could be beneficial for subsequent experiments:

1. **Granularity in Parameter Searches:** Implement more granular searches around successful mid-range configurations, optimizing further in regions highlighted during this experiment.
  
2. **Adaptive Strategies for Boundary Exploration:** Future studies might incorporate adaptive techniques that can dynamically adjust explorations based on preliminary findings, rather than pre-defining exploration limits.

3. **Investigate Continuous Functions:** Explore continuous function variations based on findings from discrete evaluations. Continuous variants may unveil additional insights into parameter interaction effects.

4. **Exploration of Higher Dimensions:** If computational resources permit, extending the dimensionality of the parameter space may yield further benefits and insights that fall within the scope of the exploratory work.

## 6. Conclusion

The Bayesian Optimization experiment successfully achieved its primary goal of identifying optimal parameters for maximizing a complex mathematical function, culminating in a maximum target value of 14.664. Throughout the optimization process, hypotheses evolved significantly, shifting away from initial broad evaluations towards focused examinations of mid-range combinations that consistently outperformed extreme configurations. This iteration of experimentation not only emphasized the importance of parameter interactions but also provided a framework for future studies in complex mathematical landscapes, reaffirming the relevance of the findings in theory development and practical applications in mathematics.
