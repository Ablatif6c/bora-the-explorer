## Experiment Overview

The goal of this experiment is to employ Bayesian Optimization (BO) to identify the optimal parameter settings that maximize a mathematical black-box function. The optimization involves manipulating 15 input variables, x_0 through x_14, each bounded within the range of (-30, 20). These parameters will guide the search process, allowing flexibility within a defined space while ensuring that the exploration remains feasible.

Bayesian Optimization is particularly suited for this task due to its effectiveness in handling expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. It will systematically explore the parameter space by constructing a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process, to predict the function's outputs based on sampled inputs. As evaluations progress, BO will refine its understanding of the function’s landscape, balancing exploration of untested areas with exploitation of known high-performing regions.

When BO experiences a plateau in performance—indicating a potential local optimum—it may require new suggestions to probe different regions of the parameter space. Hypotheses will be generated to identify combinations of parameters that could yield better outcomes, such as joint interactions between specific variables. The intended outcome is to efficiently converge on the parameter set that yields the highest target value, optimizing the function while minimizing the number of evaluations.

## Initial Thoughts

The initial sampling phase aims to thoroughly investigate multiple regions within the parameter space to maximize the target function. Selected hypotheses explore diverse combinations of input variables, including balanced central points and extreme boundaries. Points positioned at either end of the bounds, both negative and positive, are critical for uncovering nonlinear effects and unexpected responses from the function, which is vital in black-box optimization. Additionally, utilizing symmetrical values allows for investigating cooperative interactions between parameters. The blend of diverse extremes, including low and high values, enhances the exploration by revealing complex patterns and potential maxima not visible through uniform sampling. These well-considered starting points provide a solid foundation for the subsequent Bayesian Optimization process to build upon and adapt.

## Iteration 22

After analyzing the dataset from 21 iterations, the highest target value observed is 9.303, achieved at iteration 1 with all parameters set to -5. This suggests that the parameters around the center of the range may yield better outcomes than extreme combinations. Iterations with extreme values, such as those entirely set to -30 or 20, generally showed poor performance. Specifically, configurations heavily skewed towards the negative ranges consistently result in lower target outcomes. A review of the data indicates that balanced parameter combinations, hovering around mild values (especially near zero), improve performance. The patterns suggest that both negative and positive values, when mixed strategically, can potentially generate higher output. We will focus on refining our hypotheses to explore these promising parameter subspaces, targeting mixed values and slight adjustments around central tendencies, while also considering previously high-performing configurations. Discarding extreme combinations should allow for effective exploration of the optimization landscape.

### Updated Hypotheses

## Iteration 52

As we move forward into the optimization process with 51 iterations completed, the highest target value observed remains 9.303 from iteration 1, achieved when all parameters were set to -5. This result strongly indicates that configurations centered around moderate values yield significantly better outcomes compared to extreme parameter settings. Evaluating the data reveals that configurations heavily skewed toward extreme boundaries of -30 or 20 consistently underperform, leading to significantly lower targets, often below 3. The promising subspaces identified involve mixtures of positive and negative values, particularly those near zero, which contribute synergistically to maximizing the target. Notable successful hypotheses from iterations 22 to 30 achieved higher scores between 9 and 15, reflecting the potential of balanced, mid-range explorations. Consequently, we will focus our hypotheses on refined mid-range combinations and mixed values around previously successful points, discarding configurations that rely heavily on extreme values. This refined strategy aims to leverage the observed patterns of performance, while ensuring diversified exploration of the parameter space, which should help uncover optimal configurations.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Refined Balanced Mid-range Exploration

## Iteration 72

As we conclude iteration 71, the insights from the dataset highlight the evolving understanding of our optimization process. The maximum target value observed remains 15.545, achieved at iteration 55. This value suggests a promising area manipulated by mid-range parameter combinations. Further analysis indicates that configurations around mild values, especially those near zero, yield better outcomes. Configurations composed of extreme values, such as those set entirely to -30 or 20, consistently underperform, often resulting in targets below 3. There is significant evidence showing that the most beneficial subspaces comprise mixed values, leveraging both moderate positive and negative parameters. These mid-range values seem to enhance target performance due to their synergistic interactions, particularly around combinations involving slight increments from previously successful settings. Conversely, parameter combinations predominantly featuring extreme values are detrimental and hinder performance. Thus, as we refine our hypotheses, we will focus on exploring tighter mid-range combinations while discarding configurations that yield consistently low scores. Proposed hypotheses aim to uncover and refine these beneficial interactions as we continue to navigate towards optimal configurations.

## Iteration 92

As we reach iteration 91, the analysis of the dataset reveals that the highest target value achieved is 16.879 at iteration 75, showcasing the potential of well-optimized mid-range parameter combinations. This maximum indicates that configurations situated around values near zero, particularly those balancing both positive and negative parameters, yield significantly better performance. In contrast, extreme parameter settings, particularly those consisting solely of values at -30 or 20, consistently detract from target outcomes, often leading scores to fall below 3. The patterns highlight that the most effective subspaces involve diverse combinations of moderate positive and negative values, leading to enhanced synergistic interactions. This emphasizes the need to focus on tighter explorations within the mid-range zone, systematically refining hypotheses that mix previously successful configurations. Moving forward, we will discard extreme combinations that have underperformed, pivoting to mid-range values that strategically introduce both positive and negative shifts to optimize target outcomes.

## Final Conclusions

Over the course of the 105 experiments, the hypotheses underwent significant refinement based on the observed target outcomes from earlier iterations. Initially, hypotheses focused broadly on exploring combinations of extreme values and central mid-range configurations. However, as iterations progressed, it became clear that configurations skewed towards extreme values consistently yielded poor performance, while balanced, mid-range combinations were associated with significantly higher targets.

In particular, the hypothesis iterations shifted from random explorations of extreme combinations to strategically refined mid-range explorations. The successful hypotheses increasingly emphasized combinations that integrated both modest positive and negative values, reflecting enhanced synergistic interactions that contributed positively to maximizing the target. Encouraging results from mixed configurations around zero, with small positive and negative shifts, led to a better understanding of parameter relationships.

Through data-driven adjustments, hypotheses were concentrated around specific mid-range settings that gleaned higher target values, subsequently bolstering confidence in those configurations. Overall, the journey of hypothesis evolution highlights a transition from naive exploration to a focused optimization strategy that leveraged previously successful parameter sets, allowing for an effective search of beneficial interactions.
