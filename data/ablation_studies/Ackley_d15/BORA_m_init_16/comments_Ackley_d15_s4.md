## Experiment Overview

In this experiment, we aim to optimize a mathematical black-box function by finding the best parameter settings that maximize a predefined target. The optimization parameters consist of 15 continuous input variables, denoted as \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within the bounds of -30 to 20. This uniformity in bounds allows for a systematic approach to exploring the parameter space while maintaining a clear operational framework.

We will employ Bayesian Optimization (BO) to navigate this complex, high-dimensional landscape efficiently. BO will build a probabilistic model of the objective function using previously evaluated points and their corresponding target values. By iteratively selecting new points based on a balance between exploration and exploitation (such as through the Expected Improvement acquisition function), BO will hone in on regions of the parameter space that are likely to yield higher target values.

As the optimization unfolds, I will monitor for plateaus in performance. In such cases, we may need to explore alternate regions, potentially by adjusting the exploration parameter or considering nearby points that could break the stagnation. The ultimate goal is to identify the conditions and combinations of parameters that lead to the optimal maximization of the target, ensuring robust and efficient exploration of the parameter landscape.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step, we are strategically investigating the parameter space to maximize the target function. A diverse set of hypotheses aims to capture various behaviors and interactions among the parameters, ranging from extreme values to balanced configurations. Exploring points near the upper and lower boundaries can reveal potential optima, while mid-range values may provide insights into stable performance zones. Particularly, configurations like clusters of high values and random mixed extremes could uncover interactions that are less apparent. Testing different combinations helps build a robust probabilistic model of the function. Iteratively refining our approaches based on observed performance will ultimately guide us toward maximizing the target effectively.

## Iteration 22

As we progress through iteration 21 of the Bayesian Optimization, we can analyze the experimental data collected thus far. The highest target value observed in this dataset is indeed 21.945, corresponding to the balanced midpoint configuration with all parameters set to zero (iteration 2). This suggests that configurations near the center of the parameter space may have the highest potential for maximizing the target.     Our exploration has shown that more extreme configurations, such as those in iterations 1 and 3, consistently yield lower performance metrics, with target values of 2.941 and 2.080 respectively, indicating these settings may not be beneficial for our goals. Conversely, parameters clustered closer to this ideal midpoint—and especially around the recently successful configurations—appear to offer potential for improved results.     Given these findings, we should focus on mid-range values and local clusters in subsequent iterations, carefully avoiding extreme values that have proven detrimental. Our revised hypotheses will concentrate on slight variations of previously high-performing setups while avoiding configurations that led to poor outcomes. The aim remains to thoroughly explore the promising regions of the parameter space to optimize the target effectively.

## Iteration 46

As we arrive at iteration 45 of the Bayesian Optimization process, our analysis of the dataset reveals key insights into the optimization landscape. The peak target value attained is 21.945 from iteration 2, corresponding to a balanced configuration where all parameters are set to zero, indicating that values around the center of the parameter space exhibit high potential for maximizing the target. Additional promising targets are identified in iterations 22 (17.367), 23 (17.785), and 26 (19.132), reinforcing the idea that mid-range values near the zero baseline yield consistently higher results. In contrast, configurations at extremes (like those in iterations 1 and 3) have consistently underperformed, leading to lower target values, further supporting the hypothesis that exploring extreme values tends to be detrimental. The most effective subspaces appear to cluster around mid-values (between -1 and 5). Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to focus on slight perturbations and variations around previously high-performing configurations while discarding those resulting in poor outcomes. This approach aims to uncover the local structures that may further optimize the target function effectively.

## Iteration 71

As we complete iteration 70 of the Bayesian Optimization process, a thorough examination of the collected data reveals crucial insights into the optimization landscape. The highest target value observed thus far is 21.945 from iteration 2, achieved with all parameters set to zero. This result reinforces the notion that configurations around the midpoint of the parameter space are maximizing the target effectively. Other noteworthy performances include iteration 48 (19.501) and iteration 26 (19.132), both showing that configurations nearer to zero tend to produce significant results. In contrast, extreme configurations, specifically iterations 1 (2.941) and 3 (2.080), consistently yield much lower outputs, illustrating the detrimental effects of exploring extreme values. Thus, our strategy should focus on refining mid-range configurations, introducing slight variations around those that have previously yielded high targets, while discarding configurations that have proven ineffective. It remains crucial to explore the identified promising areas around the midpoint with added density and variability to thoroughly assess local maxima, while ensuring not to revert back to previously detrimental extreme configurations.

## Iteration 98

As we reach iteration 97 of the Bayesian Optimization process, the accumulated dataset provides critical insights into the optimization landscape. The highest target value observed is 21.945 from iteration 2, achieved with all parameters set to zero. This finding reinforces the conclusion that configurations close to the origin of the parameter space are highly effective in maximizing the target function. Promising configurations in iterations 22 (17.367), 23 (17.785), and 26 (19.132) demonstrate that mid-range values near the zero baseline consistently yield higher results. Conversely, extreme configurations (such as those from iterations 1 (2.941) and 3 (2.080)) consistently produce significantly lower target values and should be avoided in future explorations. Moving forward, the strategy should focus on slight variations around successfully identified configurations, particularly those near the zero baseline, to uncover potential local maxima. Careful avoidance of previously detrimental setups will ensure exploration remains focused on promising regions of the parameter space.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the series of 105 experiments, our hypotheses evolved significantly based on the experimental data we collected and analyzed after each iteration. The initial hypotheses broadly aimed at exploring both extreme and balanced configurations within the parameter space; however, as we collected target values, it became apparent that configurations around the zero baseline were yielding significantly higher results.

As we moved through iterations, the patterns in our observations highlighted the consistently lower performance of extreme configurations (e.g., settings at ±25). Thus, we shifted our focus toward fine-tuning the mid-range parameters, refining configurations that led to promising results. Importantly, we increasingly became more confident in variations around the optimal baseline (0,0,...), which consistently produced higher target values—culminating in our peak of 21.945.

The iterative analysis led to more refined hypotheses centered around slight perturbations of established high-performance configurations, with a conscious avoidance of previously detrimental setups. Consequently, this optimized our exploration strategy, allowing us to confidently investigate the promising regions of the parameter space.
