## Experiment Overview

This experiment aims to identify the optimal parameter settings for a mathematical black-box function, maximizing a defined target using Bayesian Optimization (BO). The optimization task is structured around 15 input variables, labeled \(x_0\) to \(x_{14}\), each constrained within a common range of \([-30, 20]\). These parameters will be systematically varied to explore their effects on the target function.

Bayesian Optimization will guide the search for the optimal conditions by constructing a surrogate model of the function from previously evaluated points. Initially, BO will leverage a probabilistic model to suggest points in the parameter space that are expected to yield high evaluations of the target function. The algorithm balances exploration of the space (sampling less-known areas) and exploitation of known high-performing areas to efficiently search for the optimum.

As the optimization progresses, I will monitor for plateaus where the evaluation improvements diminish. In such scenarios, I can suggest alternative sampling strategies or recommend revisiting previously untested regions within the parameter bounds. The ultimate goal is to identify the parameter settings that maximize the target function, providing valuable insights into the relationship between inputs and outputs of the black-box function.

## Initial Thoughts

In this initial sampling step, five diverse hypotheses are proposed to explore different aspects of the parameter space for maximizing the target function. The hypotheses aim to uncover various relationships and behaviors of the function by focusing on different value ranges and strategic placements within the defined bounds. The suggestions range from extreme boundaries to central and mixed values, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of the function's characteristics. Each chosen point is driven by specific rationales, such as investigating extremities, central tendencies, and symmetrical variations. This systematic exploration is essential for informing subsequent Bayesian Optimization steps, with an emphasis on finding conditions conducive to high target values.

## Iteration 22

At iteration 21, we have gathered significant insights from the dataset of 21 experiments regarding the optimization of our black-box function. The highest observed target value of 15.827 was achieved during the very first iteration, where the parameters were approximately centered around zero. The next most favorable target was considerably lower, at 6.270 in iteration 16, indicating that central and near-zero values are indeed promising areas for further exploration. Conversely, extreme values, particularly those at iteration 2 (all parameters set to 20), yielded a minimal target of 2.312. Additionally, iterations with highly negative values, such as the combination at iteration 20 yielding a target of only 0.885, demonstrate that these regions also underperform. The analysis suggests that a focus on balanced, moderate parameter settings, particularly in the central negative to low positive ranges, may yield the best outcomes. These observations warrant refining our hypotheses to explore promising central areas, while discarding extremes that have consistently resulted in lower targets. Moreover, testing slightly varied mid-range values could uncover beneficial interactions among parameters that enhance target performance.

## Iteration 42

As we progress through iteration 41, the optimization process has yielded several critical insights from the accumulated dataset. The highest observed target value is 17.731, achieved during iteration 22 with parameters clustered around the central negative region. This reinforces the notion that configurations close to zero, specifically in the range of approximately -3 to 5, are favorable for maximizing the target. Consistently, points around moderate positive settings have produced better outcomes, while extreme parameter values, whether high or low, tend to perform poorly. For instance, configurations resulting in targets below 3 have been primarily near the bounds, evidencing a detrimental effect. The data supports a strategic focus on balanced and moderate configurations. Therefore, it is imperative to refine our hypotheses to emphasize the mid-range configurations that correlate with successful outcomes while discarding those that have consistently underperformed. Moving forward, we will concentrate on hypotheses that attract clusters of parameter values around the zero to low positive ranges as our primary avenue for exploring and optimizing the target function.

## Iteration 62

As we reach iteration 61, the optimization process has revealed critical insights from the accumulated dataset of 61 experiments. The highest observed target value is 18.932, achieved during iteration 42 with parameter configurations focused on the central negative region near zero. This reinforces our hypothesis that moderate parameter settings yield better performance in the target function. Combinations around zero, particularly those near -2 to 5, demonstrate significantly better results. Conversely, extreme values, both high (like those from iteration 2) and low (as shown in iterations with heavily negative clusters), consistently lower target outcomes, often below 1. Consequently, future hypotheses should prioritize further exploration of the central negative region and mild positive values while avoiding configurations that have repeatedly yielded poor performance. Our strategy will enhance focus on balanced configurations across the mid-range of the parameter space to uncover beneficial interactions and improve target maximization.

## Iteration 84

As we approach iteration 83, our extensive dataset comprised of 83 experiments reveals several critical insights about maximizing the target function. The highest observed target value is 18.932, achieved during iteration 42, where configurations were clustered around the central negative region, particularly near -2, which supports the notion that parameter settings close to zero yield higher outcomes. Consistently, configurations in the central negative to low positive range have performed significantly better compared to extremes, yielding poor results. For instance, iterations with boundary values or heavily negative settings have consistently led to targets below 3, illustrating their detrimental effects. These findings emphasize the need to maintain a focus on balanced, moderate configurations, particularly around the range of -2 to 5, to capitalize on beneficial parameter interactions. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to further target mid-range configurations while discarding those that have proven ineffective. Our next steps will emphasize the exploration of central negative values, light positive variations, and symmetrical adjustments, all designed to uncover additional maximization opportunities.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, our hypotheses evolved significantly based on insights garnered from the experimental data. Initially, the focus was on exploring a wide range of parameter settings, including both extremes and central values. However, as iterations progressed, it became clear that central and moderate parameter settings (predominantly around -2 to low positives) yielded significantly higher target values, peaking at 18.932.

With increasing data points, we began to discard less effective extremes and concentrate our hypotheses on balanced configurations in the central negative and low positive ranges. Our strategy shifted towards refining these hypotheses, emphasizing previously successful clusters rather than exploring uncharted territories or extremes, which had consistently resulted in poor performance.

The confidence levels in hypotheses adjusted in alignment with experiment outcomes. As certain configurations proved successful, confidence in hypotheses targeting the central negative spectrum strengthened, while those based on extremes were marked down. This adaptive process allowed us to systematically hone in on maximizing conditions for the target function.

Here is a summary of how confidence in hypotheses evolved during the optimization:
