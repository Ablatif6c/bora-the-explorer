## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "As we evaluate our optimization progress after five iterations, several meaningful insights emerge from our experimental dataset. The highest target value recorded was 21.945 from iteration 1, corresponding to the hypothesis centered at the origin (0,0,...). This indicates that central regions within the parameter space, especially around the origin, are promising for achieving higher outputs. Meanwhile, the second hypothesis focused on upper extremes resulted in a significantly lower score of 4.652, suggesting that extreme positive values may detrimentally affect our target. Similarly, the negative exploration in iteration 5 yielded a target of 3.142, reinforcing that both positive and negative extremes do not enhance performance. The uniform positive sampling returned a modest 9.303, indicating that uniform approaches may need further refinement as well. In summary, we recognize that the central areas likely maximize the target output, while we should avoid extreme configurations that minimize it. Moving forward, it will be essential to refine our hypotheses based on these insights, emphasizing exploration around the origin and incorporating slight variations around this central point. Discarding poorly performing hypotheses, we will focus on new ones that utilize successful central patterns while accommodating possible variations to further navigate this landscape.",

## Iteration 9:
{
    "comment": "Upon reviewing the optimization progress through iteration 8, the highest target value recorded is 21.945 from iteration 1. This indicates that central values around the origin yield the best results, reinforcing the idea that we should focus our exploration in this region. Subsequent iterations (6 and 7) also produced substantial values of 18.320 and 17.475, respectively, which further confirms the potential of the central area. In contrast, configurations that approached the extremes, as evidenced in iterations 2 and 5, resulted in lower outputs of 4.652 and 3.142, suggesting that extreme values, both positive and negative, detract from the target. The mixed exploration in iteration 8 yielded a reasonable output of 12.086 but did not surpass previous successful outputs. Given this information, we should concentrate our hypotheses on slight variations and configurations around the successful central values. Our focus must shift away from any hypotheses that tested uniform or extreme configurations, as they consistently performed poorly. Instead, we will enhance our current hypotheses to explore promising variations in the central subspace, which we believe holds the key to maximizing our target objective effectively.",

## Iteration 12:
{
    "comment": "As we analyze the optimization progress through iteration 11, the data reveals crucial insights regarding the effectiveness of various parameter configurations. The highest recorded target value remains 21.945, which was achieved during iteration 1, indicating a strong performance associated with configurations near the origin (0,0,...). Results from subsequent hypotheses around this central region, such as outputs of 18.320 and 17.475, demonstrate the potential of exploring slight variations in this area. Meanwhile, extreme configurations, as evidenced in iterations 2 and 5, consistently returned lower outputs, with scores like 4.652 and 3.142, underscoring that diverging too far from the center is detrimental to performance.The most promising subspaces are evidently around the central area, with configurations skewed towards the origin yielding significantly higher target outputs. Conversely, experimental points that approach extremes or exhibit uniformity typically performed poorly. Given this data, it is crucial to refine our hypotheses, focusing on slight adjustments near the successful central configurations while discarding poorly performing extremes. The next steps will emphasize exploring narrowly between moderately high-performing configurations to unearth potential local maxima. This well-informed strategy should enhance our ability to maximize the target output efficiently.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
