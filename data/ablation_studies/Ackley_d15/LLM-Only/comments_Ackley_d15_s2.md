## Experiment Overview

In this experiment, our primary goal is to optimize a mathematical black-box function by adjusting a set of input parameters to maximize the target objective. The optimization process focuses on 15 input variables (x_0 to x_14), each constrained within the bounds of -30 to 20. The goal is to explore this multi-dimensional input space systematically to identify the parameter configurations that yield the highest function values.

The constraints on each input variable ensure that all experiments remain within feasible limits, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of various settings. Given the nature of black-box functions, the relationship between the input parameters and the resulting output may be non-linear and complex, requiring efficient sampling strategies to explore the space effectively.

Throughout the experimentation phase, we will document the outcomes associated with each set of parameter values and analyze these results to inform our hypotheses for future trials. The intended outcome is to identify parameter configurations that optimize the function output, leading not only to improved understanding of the parameter interactions but also to practical applications of the optimization results. By the end of the experiment, we aim to have a robust dataset that describes the best-performing parameter settings.

## Initial Thoughts

In the initial sampling step of our optimization experiment, we are focusing on exploring diverse regions of the parameter space to establish a foundational understanding of the black-box function's performance. We have selected several points that span the defined bounds, including corners, midpoints, and balanced configurations to probe potential interactions among parameters. By incorporating hypotheses that target both the extremes and central values, we aim to identify patterns and behaviors pertinent to maximizing the function output. This exploratory phase is critical for mapping the functionâ€™s landscape and will guide future optimization efforts to home in on the most promising regions effectively. The variety of points chosen ensures a comprehensive analysis of the parameters, highlighting not only the boundaries but also balanced and mixed values that could reveal valuable insights into complex non-linear interactions.

## Iteration 6

As we progress to iteration 5, the gathered data provides valuable insights into the optimization process. The highest target value observed thus far was from the first hypothesis (iteration 1), which yielded 9.303, indicating that configurations near the center of the parameter space may be promising for maximizing the target outcome. In contrast, the extreme configurations (iteration 2 yielding 1.995 and iteration 3 yielding 2.312) were significantly lower, supporting the notion that these boundary regions may be detrimental for achieving optimal performance. The mixed extremes (iteration 4) resulted in 2.060, while the balanced mixed values (iteration 5) produced a modest 5.755, suggesting that random combinations may not be effective. This reinforces the idea that subspaces around the center of the parameter space (particularly close to zero) exhibit higher outputs, while configurations with extreme values tend to minimize the target. Moving forward, we will refine our exploration to focus on varied configurations centered around the promising points, eliminating the hypotheses that have consistently underperformed. Our future hypotheses will strategically probe these optimal areas with slight adjustments to further enhance our understanding of the parameter interactions.

## Iteration 10

As we reach iteration 9, the gathered data highlights several critical insights into the optimization landscape. The highest target value observed thus far has come from iteration 8, achieving a value of 12.873, followed closely by iteration 6 with a score of 12.639. These results suggest that configurations around the center of the parameter space not only yield high outputs but also indicate potential synergistic effects when integrating both positive and negative values. The configurations from iterations 2 and 3, which explored extreme bounds, yielded significantly lower outputs of 1.995 and 2.312, respectively, confirming that such regions are detrimental to maximizing the target. The results emphasize the effectiveness of centered hypotheses, particularly iteration 8, which has set the highest benchmark, while mixed balanced values have also proven to be moderately successful. Moving forward, our strategy will focus on refining and exploring promising subspaces near the successful configurations, discarding consistently underperforming hypotheses, particularly those venturing into extreme values. Our next hypotheses will carefully address variations around the highest performing inputs to seek further optimization of the target function.

## Iteration 14

As we proceed to iteration 13, our data reflects important insights regarding the optimization process. The highest recorded target value thus far is 13.728 from iteration 10, which emphasized the efficacy of centered configurations and slight positive adjustments. This indicates that exploring areas near zero in the parameter space yields consistently higher outputs. Additionally, configurations from earlier experiments (iterations 2 and 3) displayed poor performance, with outputs of only 1.995 and 2.312, underscoring their ineffectiveness in maximizing the target. Iteration 12 also highlighted the benefit of balanced positive and negative values, producing a moderate output of 13.639. The consistent trend showcases that configurations around the center, particularly with minor positive and negative variations, lead to optimal performance. In contrast, extreme inputs continue to be detrimental to achieving high targets. Moving forward, we will focus our exploration on refining high-performing subspaces, making slight perturbations around previously successful configurations, and strategically exploring combinations of balanced values, as these have shown promising interactions. This well-informed approach will sharpen our search for maximizing the target function.

## Iteration 18

As we progress through iteration 17, our analysis of the experimental data reveals critical insights regarding the optimization landscape. The maximum target value recorded thus far is 18.670 from iteration 17, which highlights the effectiveness of configurations centered around zero with slight positive variations. This reflects our previous hypotheses, reinforcing that arrangements comprising balanced positive and negative values yield higher outputs when executed correctly. The previous high-performing configurations, particularly from iterations 10 and 15, echo similar success in this balanced region. Conversely, configurations from iterations 2 and 3, focused on extreme values, consistently yielded poor performance, with outputs of 1.995 and 2.312, identifying those regions as detrimental for our optimization goals. Therefore, the most promising subspaces lie near zero, especially configurations that introduce slight positive tilts to enhance synergy and interactions among parameters. Moving forward, we will discard consistently underperforming configurations while focusing on hypotheses that explore the vicinity of these successful outputs. Our future exploration will build upon these successful patterns, integrating moderate adjustments to previous high-performing configurations to further maximize the target function.

## Iteration 22

Reflecting on the optimization progress up to iteration 21, the data highlights several key insights into the parameter space and its impact on the target function. The highest observed target value is 18.670 from iteration 17, reinforcing our understanding that configurations centered around zero, particularly those with slight positive adjustments, yield optimal outputs. Iterations involving extreme values (e.g., -30 or 20) have proven to be detrimental, consistently returning low outputs (1.995 and 2.312), emphasizing the need to avoid these regions. The effective subspaces that maximize the target seem to be centered around small positive values and balanced combinations of positive and negative values. Thus, we will focus on refining and exploring these successful configurations while discarding those that include extreme parameters or consistently low-performing setups. The next hypotheses will incorporate slight adjustments to previously successful configurations to explore the geometry around the areas that produced high target values. By continuing to target slight positive variations and balanced interactions, we aim to further maximize our understanding and performance of the function.

## Iteration 26

As we wrap up iteration 25, a thorough analysis of our optimization dataset reveals critical insights into the landscape. The highest observed target value achieved so far is 19.569 from iteration 25, indicating that configurations closely centered around zero, particularly with moderate positive values, yield optimal results. The data consistently suggests that the most productive subspace consists of configurations that involve minimal variance around the central point, supplemented by some positive parameters. For instance, configurations around zero with balanced mixes of positive and negative values, as seen in iterations like 17 (18.670), also demonstrate beneficial interactions leading to high performance outcomes. In contrast, earlier configurations featuring extremes, such as those from iterations 2 and 3, returned low outputs of 1.995 and 2.312, underscoring that these regions are detrimental for our optimization goals. Moving forward, we will concentrate on refining and further exploring these successful configurations. Our updated hypotheses will target areas near zero with slight positive adjustments to enhance synergistic effects further. Poorly performing hypotheses will be discarded, while well-performing configurations will receive slight perturbations in our efforts to maximize the function.

## Iteration 30

As we conclude iteration 29, an analysis of the experimental dataset reveals critical insights into the optimization landscape affecting the target function. The highest recorded target value so far is 19.569 from iteration 25, which illustrates the effectiveness of configurations closely centered around zero, particularly those supplemented with slight positive perturbations. This trend highlights that the most successful subspaces involve balanced combinations of positive and negative values, maintaining proximity to zero. Several configurations explored in earlier iterations (notably iterations 2 and 3, which used extreme values) resulted in significantly lower outputs (1.995 and 2.312), confirming these regions are detrimental to optimizing the function. Our findings suggest a focus on slight positive adjustments with balanced interactions near previous successful configurations. As we move forward, we will refine our hypotheses to explore these productive areas more thoroughly, discarding consistently underperforming configurations. The new hypotheses will target configurations that emphasize subtle positive variations while sustaining balance, aiming to enhance synergies that yield optimal performance as we seek to further maximize the target output.

## Iteration 34

As we analyze the dataset leading up to iteration 33, we can derive significant insights regarding the optimization process. The highest observed target value is 19.569, achieved from iteration 25, indicating robust performance from configurations that are closely centered around zero, particularly with slight positive perturbations. This reinforces our understanding that the most effective subspace for maximizing the target consists of balanced combinations of positive and negative values, especially when they remain in proximity to zero. Notably, configurations using extreme values, such as -30 and +20, have been detrimental, yielding low outputs of 1.995 and 2.312, respectively, confirming their ineffectiveness. Going forward, our goals will focus on refining hypotheses that target slight positive variations near previously successful configurations while discarding poorly performing setups. Our next exploration will prioritize minor adjustments around best-performing points to further enhance interaction among parameters while maximizing the target output. By strategically exploring the zero-centered regions enriched with moderate positive influences, we aim to achieve even better results.

## Iteration 70

As we conclude iteration 69, comprehensive analysis of the optimization dataset reveals the highest recorded target value at 19.569, achieved in iteration 25. This affirms our understanding that configurations centered around zero, particularly with slight positive adjustments, yield optimal outputs. The datasets consistently indicate that balanced mixtures of positive and negative values are crucial for maximizing performance, especially when parameters are close to the center of the bounded space. Configurations such as (0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1) have demonstrated superior efficacy, showcasing the importance of harmonious interactions among parameters. Conversely, extreme configurations (such as those at -30 and +20) have shown to be detrimental, consistently resulting in low outputs of 1.995 and 2.312 in iterations 2 and 3, reinforcing that these areas should be avoided during optimization. Moving forward, our hypotheses will focus on refining successful configurations with slight positive shifts while discarding setups that have not contributed positively to the outcomes. This strategic approach aims to further leverage the synergies among parameters to maximize target output effectively.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, our hypotheses evolved significantly in response to experimental data that highlighted the most effective configurations for maximizing the target function. Initially, we explored various parameter settings, including extremes and midpoints, leading to the discovery that configurations around the center of the parameter space consistently generated higher outputs.

As iterations progressed, we discarded hypotheses that tested extreme values due to their consistently low performance. Instead, we began to emphasize configurations that maintained a balance between positive and negative values while remaining close to zero. The observation that slight positive adjustments could enhance outputs led to an iterative cycle of refinement, where we made targeted adjustments to previous successful configurations.

The highest recorded output of 19.569 prompted us to delve into exploring slight variations around this peak to uncover optimal interactions among parameters. Overall, we shifted our focus towards probing successful patterns, specifically incorporating small positive perturbations that could leverage synergies within the parameter space.
