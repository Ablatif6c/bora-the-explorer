Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 8.
3 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.
You generated the following comments in the previous iterations and your suggestion points were subsequently evaluated and appended to the dataset:
## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "As we evaluate our optimization progress after five iterations, several meaningful insights emerge from our experimental dataset. The highest target value recorded was 21.945 from iteration 1, corresponding to the hypothesis centered at the origin (0,0,...). This indicates that central regions within the parameter space, especially around the origin, are promising for achieving higher outputs. Meanwhile, the second hypothesis focused on upper extremes resulted in a significantly lower score of 4.652, suggesting that extreme positive values may detrimentally affect our target. Similarly, the negative exploration in iteration 5 yielded a target of 3.142, reinforcing that both positive and negative extremes do not enhance performance. The uniform positive sampling returned a modest 9.303, indicating that uniform approaches may need further refinement as well. In summary, we recognize that the central areas likely maximize the target output, while we should avoid extreme configurations that minimize it. Moving forward, it will be essential to refine our hypotheses based on these insights, emphasizing exploration around the origin and incorporating slight variations around this central point. Discarding poorly performing hypotheses, we will focus on new ones that utilize successful central patterns while accommodating possible variations to further navigate this landscape.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
