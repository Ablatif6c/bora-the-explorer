Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 8.
3 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.
You generated the following comments in the previous iterations and your suggestion points were subsequently evaluated and appended to the dataset:
## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "As we progress through the optimization iterations, we've compiled a dataset from five experiments that provides crucial insights into the behavior of the black-box function. The highest observed target value is 9.303 from iteration 2, where all parameters were set to 5. This suggests that a balanced approach within the mid-range parameters is likely optimal. In contrast, the extreme configuration from iteration 1, where all parameters were set to 20, yielded the lowest target of 2.312, indicating that extreme positive values are detrimental. The diverse combination tested in iteration 3 achieved a moderate target of 4.568; however, this did not surpass the mid-range result. From this data, we can conclude that the most promising subspace lies around the value of 5 for each parameter. Meanwhile, configurations with extreme positive values, such as in iterations 1 and 5, and fully negative settings, as in iteration 4, seem to hurt performance significantly. Moving forward, I will focus on refining my hypotheses to further explore variations around the successful mid-range values, all while considering slight diversifications to maximize potential interactions while maintaining an effective balance.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
