Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 7.
2 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.
You generated the following comments in the previous iterations and your suggestion points were subsequently evaluated and appended to the dataset:
## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "In this initial sampling phase of our optimization experiment, we explored a diverse set of hypotheses to capture the behavior of the black-box function across various regions of the parameter space. The hypotheses examined ranged from central values to extreme boundaries, with trials targeting both stable and potentially high-performance configurations. Our initial points revealed significant interactions between parameters, notably around extreme values and central tendencies. We hypothesize that the function's performance may peak in ranges where parameters are balanced with mixed values, rather than purely focusing on extrema, as indicated by initial evaluations. Consequently, we observed that while certain combinations of extreme inputs produced high outcomes, they often lacked stability across multiple trials. The data suggests an area of potential maxima near the mid-range values where parameters are positively correlated. This insight emphasizes the importance of refining our hypotheses based on collected observations, particularly in exploring less extreme configurations that led to promising outputs. Overall, leveraging this preliminary dataset, we will strategically investigate these balanced configurations to maximize the target output effectively.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
