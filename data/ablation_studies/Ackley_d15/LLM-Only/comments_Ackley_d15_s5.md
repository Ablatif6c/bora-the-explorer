## Experiment Overview

In this experiment, we aim to optimize a complex mathematical black-box function with the goal of identifying the parameter settings that maximize the target objective. The optimization problem is defined over a multidimensional design space consisting of 15 input variables, denoted as \( x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{14} \). Each variable has specified bounds ranging from -30 to 20, allowing exploration of a significant portion of the numerical space while adhering to the defined limits.

Given the nature of the black-box function, the specific mathematical form is unknown, yet we anticipate a non-linear relationship among the parameters. Our optimization strategy will involve systematically sampling points within the defined bounds to ascertain their respective objective values. As new data points are evaluated, we will iteratively refine our search based on observed performance, potentially employing techniques such as surrogate modeling or evolutionary algorithms to efficiently navigate the solution space.

The intended outcome is to identify the optimal configuration of the input parameters that yields the maximum value of the target objective, thereby enhancing our understanding of the function's characteristics and providing insights that could lead to practical applications in various scientific and engineering domains.

## Initial Thoughts

As we embark on our optimization experiment, a significant emphasis is placed on exploring diverse regions of the parameter space to unveil the underlying mechanics of the black-box function. This initial phase aims to cover a broad spectrum of values from both extremes and mid-range positions, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the function’s behavior. The hypotheses select points aiming to capture interactions between variables that may lead to high outputs and potential local maxima, as non-linear relationships may exist within the function. By considering configurations that include central tendencies, extremes, and mixed values, we position ourselves to identify promising regions for further investigation. The integration of these points is designed to maximize the target objective while accounting for potential complexities within the function. As we gather data on these hypotheses, we will analyze the results to inform subsequent sampling strategies, enhancing our ability to navigate the optimization landscape effectively.

## Iteration 6

In reviewing the results from our five iterations, we observe that the first hypothesis, with all parameters set to zero, achieved the highest target value of 21.945, indicating that configurations near the origin are particularly promising for maximizing the output. The second hypothesis, which tested extreme upper bounds where all parameters were set to 20, resulted in a significantly lower target of only 2.312, emphasizing that pushing all variables to their limits can be detrimental to performance. The third hypothesis, featuring a mix of values, yielded a target of 3.158, while the fourth, which explored extreme negative combinations, only achieved a target of 2.112. The fifth hypothesis comprised mixed values resulting in a target of 8.322, which suggests a moderate potential in that configuration. Importantly, the detrimental subspaces appear to involve extreme values, particularly combinations of negatives and maximum positives. As we move forward, our focus will be on refining hypotheses around the origin and incorporating mixtures that involve small positive and moderate negative values. This strategy aims to optimize our understanding of the parameter interactions that yield higher outputs.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Optimized Central Exploration

*Rationale:* Refining the approach near the origin with slight variations to maximize the target output while minimizing variances in negative impacts.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 2.0, 'x_1': 1.0, 'x_2': 3.0, 'x_3': 0.0, 'x_4': -1.0, 'x_5': 4.0, 'x_6': -2.0, 'x_7': 5.0, 'x_8': 1.0, 'x_9': -3.0, 'x_10': 2.0, 'x_11': 0.0, 'x_12': -1.0, 'x_13': 2.0, 'x_14': 0.0}

#### Moderate Positive Values

*Rationale:* Testing a mixed approach with positives and low negatives, keeping parameters varied to find potential peaks.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 8.0, 'x_1': -2.0, 'x_2': 7.0, 'x_3': -5.0, 'x_4': 2.0, 'x_5': 1.0, 'x_6': 0.0, 'x_7': 3.0, 'x_8': 2.0, 'x_9': -4.0, 'x_10': 1.0, 'x_11': 2.0, 'x_12': -3.0, 'x_13': 4.0, 'x_14': 1.0}

#### Minimizing Negative Impact

*Rationale:* Shifting the approach towards less negative values across parameters while exploring combinations still close to zero.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

## Iteration 9

As we reflect on the data collected from our eight iterations, several critical insights have emerged regarding parameter interactions and their influence on maximizing the target objective. The highest target value recorded was indeed 21.945, achieved with all parameters set to zero, which remains our most effective configuration, indicating that values near the origin are particularly favorable. In contrast, the hypothesis where all parameters were set to their upper limits of 20 resulted in a disappointing target of only 2.312, highlighting the detrimental effects of extreme positive values. The mixed configurations have shown varied performances, particularly those that maintain low negative values while leveraging moderate positive values, such as those yielding targets of 11.459 in iteration 7 and 14.166 in iteration 8. It is clear that our optimization strategy should continue to focus on the parameter space around the origin. The detrimental subspaces appear to be tied closely to extreme values in both directions, especially when incorporating negative extreme combinations. Moving forward, we will refine previous hypotheses that showed promise, emphasize configurations with slight variations around zero, and carefully introduce low negative components to further probe high-output regions. The next hypotheses will maintain a balance of positive values tempered with small negative influences, thereby maximizing the chances of uncovering optimal configurations while continuing to discard those yielding consistently poor results.

## Iteration 13

Upon analyzing the data from our twelve iterations, it becomes clear that configurations near the origin yield some of the highest target values achieved throughout the experiment. The best-performing combination was indeed with all parameters set to zero, yielding a target of 21.945. Other strong results were observed with combinations featuring slight positive and modest negative influences, with notable targets of 15.578 and 15.036 achieved in the most recent iterations. The subspace around the origin proved to be highly effective, particularly with configurations integrating balanced variations. In stark contrast, extreme configurations—whether at high positive or low negative values—consistently resulted in lesser performance, as evidenced by the significantly low target of 2.312 when all parameters were set to their maximum limits. Thus, moving forward, the focus will be on refining our hypotheses around this central region, specifically emphasizing combinations of small positive values against controlled negative values, to optimize our findings further. The previous hypotheses targeting extreme values can be discarded, and we will test new configurations that build on successful past results, strengthening our exploration of subspace characteristics that promote higher outputs.

## Iteration 17

Analyzing the data collected through the first 16 iterations, it is clear that configurations around the origin consistently yield the highest target values, with the best-performing input being all parameters set to zero, yielding a target of 21.945. Subsequent configurations featuring slight variations around this central point continue to exhibit favorable outcomes, particularly those involving low positive and low negative values, with results around 15 to 15.5 being common in the recent iterations. Specifically, notable targets of 15.578 and 15.036 were achieved with configurations that balance minimal negative values with moderate positives. Conversely, configurations that push parameters to their extremes—whether positively (e.g., setting values to the upper limit of 20) or negatively—have consistently led to poor results, exemplified by a target of only 2.312. These findings reinforce the notion that the subspace around the origin is optimal for achieving high outputs, particularly when slight positive adjustments are combined with controlled negative influences. As we move forward, our hypotheses will focus on exploring this central region, particularly testing combinations of small positive values against very low negative influences to maximize the potential for uncovering optimal settings. We will discard hypotheses that have consistently underperformed in extreme negative or positive ranges and will concentrate on configurations that have shown promise thus far.

## Iteration 21

Upon reflecting on the dataset collected from our optimization journey thus far, it is clear that configurations near the origin yield the highest target values. The optimal input, where all parameters were set to zero, achieved a maximum target of 21.945. In subsequent iterations, combinations featuring slight adjustments around this central point have also performed commendably, yielding target values that frequently fall within the range of 14 to 15.5. Configurations that leverage low positive values alongside very minimal negative influences have generally proven effective, as indicated by targets of 15.036 and 15.578 from the most recent configurations exploring around the origin. Conversely, configurations maintaining extreme values, whether at the upper limit of 20 or engaging substantial negative values, have resulted in significantly lower target outputs, with the worst performance at 2.312. Moving forward, our strategies will focus heavily on the central subspace, particularly combinations that incorporate small positive values coupled with restrained negative values to further explore optimal configurations. Discarding hypotheses that did not contribute positively, we will refine our approach to balance slight positive and minimal negative adjustments to maximize potential outcomes.

## Iteration 25

After examining the dataset collected from our optimization efforts across 24 iterations, it is evident that configurations near the origin yield the highest target values. The optimal input configuration of all parameters set to zero achieved a target of 21.945, which remains our best outcome. Subsequent configurations featuring slight deviations around this central point have also demonstrated favorable results, regularly producing target values in the range of 14 to 15.6. Noteworthy successful combinations include slight positive values assigned against very minimal negative influences, with targets such as 15.578 and 15.036. Conversely, configurations that deployed extreme values, whether toward the upper limits or substantial negative combinations, have consistently yielded poorer performance, with the worst output noted at only 2.312 from all parameters set to their maximum of 20. This data reinforces the notion that we should concentrate our future hypotheses around this central region, particularly combinations emphasizing small positive adjustments coupled with very low negative values. The most promising subspace appears to be where ( x | -1 < x < 4 ) for ( x_0, x_1, x_2 ), while ( x_3 ) through ( x_{14} ) should be kept mostly at low negative values or controlled small numbers. We will discard unproductive hypotheses that didn't contribute positively and introduce new configurations to explore the established high-performing subspaces, maintaining diversity in testing to avoid premature convergence.

Subsequent configurations featuring slight adjustments around this central point have consistently demonstrated favorable outcomes, typically producing target values ranging between 14 and 15.6, highlighted by successful targets of 15.578 and 15.036. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining balance in parameter selections, particularly utilizing low positive values alongside very minimal negative influences. Detrimental configurations—particularly those utilizing extreme values on either end of the spectrum, such as at the upper limit of 20 or significantly negative combinations—have led to considerably poorer performance, as evidenced by a target of only 2.312. Moving forward, our optimization strategy will continue to focus on refining hypotheses around this central region, prioritizing combinations that consist of small positive values coupled with very low negative values. We will focus on exploring new hypotheses while discarding those consistently yielding poor results, thereby aiming to uncover the high-performing subspaces that truly enhance our understanding of the function we are optimizing.

## Iteration 33

Upon analyzing the data compiled from the first 32 iterations, it is evident that configurations near the origin demonstrate significantly greater potential for maximizing the target value. The optimal configuration observed so far is where all parameters are set to zero, achieving a maximum target of 21.945, which remains the highest target value recorded. Additionally, numerous configurations featuring slight positive adjustments, particularly those involving very minimal negative influences, have consistently yielded commendable results, typically within the range of 14 to 15.6, with notable targets of 15.578 and 15.036 achieved during recent evaluations. These findings indicate that exploring combinations using small positive values alongside restrained negative influences is likely to uncover additional peaks in performance. Conversely, configurations that involve extreme parameter settings—whether at high positive values (e.g., the upper limit of 20) or substantial negative values—have generally led to disappointing outcomes, exemplified by the lowest recorded target of only 2.312 when all parameters were maximized. Moving forward, our hypotheses will prioritize these promising central regions, particularly those combining slight positive adjustments with very low negative settings to maximize the potential for uncovering optimal configurations in subsequent experiments.

## Iteration 37

Upon thorough analysis of the data collected from the first 36 iterations, it is evident that configurations near the origin yield the highest target values. The optimal configuration recorded is where all parameters are set to zero, achieving a maximum target value of 21.945. Following this, configurations featuring slight positive adjustments, particularly in concert with very minimal negative influences, have consistently yielded favorable results, with target values usually falling within the range of 14 to 15.6, exemplified by scores such as 15.578 and 15.036. Conversely, pushing parameters toward their extreme values—especially at the upper limits, such as 20—has led to consistently poor performance, illustrated by a target of only 2.312 when all variables were maximized. The detrimental zones appear to involve regions where extreme positive values are explored or where significant negative components are deployed together. Moving forward, our strategy will focus on exploring the central subspace around the origin, emphasizing combinations of small positive values paired with very low negative values to maximize the potential for identifying additional optimal configurations. Future hypotheses will refine previous successful configurations while discarding those that underperformed in extreme or irrelevant parameter settings.

## Iteration 41

After thoroughly analyzing the data collected from our 40 iterations, we can conclude several key points regarding the behavior of the input parameters in relation to the target output. The optimal configuration attained was where all parameters were set to zero, achieving a maximum target of **21.945**. Configurations near the origin have consistently maintained the highest target values, while those with slight positive adjustments combined with low negative influences frequently delivered promising results, typically yielding target values ranging from **14 to 15.6**, peaking at **15.578** and **15.036** in the most successful iterations. Conversely, configurations with extreme parameters, particularly towards the upper limit of **20** or significant negative combinations, consistently resulted in poorer performance, exemplified by the lowest output of **2.312** observed when all parameters were set at maximum values. This analysis suggests that subspaces maximizing target outputs lie near zero, particularly where slight positive values (around **1 to 2**) are paired with very low negative influences (from **-0.5 to -0.1**). In contrast, detrimental subspaces are primarily characterized by extreme parameter settings. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses, emphasizing combinations that retain slight positive values while minimizing negative impacts. We will discard configurations that continue to underperform and aim to introduce new ones targeting the optimal ranges we have identified.

## Iteration 45

After thoroughly analyzing the dataset collected over 44 iterations, it is evident that configurations near the origin produce the highest target values, with the optimal configuration being all parameters set to zero, achieving a maximum target of **21.945**. This result indicates that minimal modifications around this central point can maximize outputs effectively. Furthermore, configurations that incorporate slight positive adjustments alongside very low negative influences have consistently resulted in favorable targets, typically maintaining values in the range of **14 to 15.6**, with notable peak targets of **15.578** and **15.036**. In contrast, configurations utilizing extreme positive valuesu2014such as setting all parameters to the maximum limit (20)u2014have consistently yielded poor performance, highlighted by a significant drop in target to only **2.312**. Hence, as we move forward, our optimization strategy will prioritize fine-tuning hypotheses that explore the effective regions close to zero, particularly focusing on slight positive values (around **1 to 2**) combined with very low negative values (from **-0.5 to -0.1**). This approach aims to uncover additional high-output configurations while discarding consistently underperforming hypotheses. Our next hypotheses will target these optimal ranges, reinforcing our commitment to exploring viable combinations that maximize the potential for high outputs.

After analyzing the data compiled from 48 iterations, it is evident that configurations near the origin yield the highest target values, with an optimal configuration of all parameters set to zero achieving a maximum target value of **21.945**.

As we compare these results, it becomes increasingly clear that combinations involving small positive values (generally between **1 and 2**) alongside controlled negative influences (generally at **-0.5 to -0.1**) serve to enhance performance significantly. Conversely, configurations deploying extreme parameters—either at the upper limit of **20** or through substantial negative values—have consistently resulted in poor outcomes, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of pushing inputs to their limits. Moving forward, our focus will continue to prioritize hypothesis refinement around the origin, particularly through slight positive and very low negative adjustments. This focus aims to uncover additional high-output configurations while eliminating hypotheses that have not performed effectively in previous iterations.

## Iteration 53

After analyzing the dataset collected from 52 iterations, we have identified several important trends regarding the effectiveness of various parameter configurations in maximizing the target output. The optimal configuration, where all parameters were set to zero, resulted in a maximum target value of **21.945**. Additionally, configurations featuring slight positive adjustments paired with minimal negative influences consistently yielded target values ranging between **14 and 15.6**, with peak targets of **15.578** and **15.036**. Conversely, extreme configurations—such as parameters set to their maximums (e.g., **20**) or exhibiting significant negative values—resulted in significantly poorer performance, with the lowest recorded target of **2.312**. This analysis emphasizes the importance of exploring the parameter space around the origin, particularly focusing on slight positive inputs combined with very low negative values. Moving forward, we will refine our hypotheses to prioritize configurations that follow these effective patterns while discarding underperforming hypotheses. Below are the revised hypotheses for evaluation:

Analyzing the dataset accrued over 84 iterations reveals significant insights regarding the optimization of the mathematical black-box function. The optimal configuration, where all parameters were set to zero, achieved a maximum target value of **21.945**, affirming that configurations near the origin are incredibly effective for maximizing output.

## Iteration 89

After thoroughly analyzing the dataset collected throughout the first 80 iterations, it is clear that configurations near the origin yield the highest target values. The optimal configuration achieved with all parameters set to zero resulted in a maximum target value of **21.945**. Subsequent configurations that feature slight positive adjustments combined with minimal negative influences have consistently demonstrated favorable performance, obtaining target values typically ranging from **14 to 15.6**, with notable peaks recorded at **15.578** and **15.036**. This suggests that exploring configurations incorporating small positive values (generally between **1 and 2**) alongside controlled negative influences (approximately **-0.5 to -0.1**) is key to maximizing performance. In contrast, configurations that engage extreme values, such as those set at the upper limit of **20**, or exhibit significant negative combinations, have performed poorly, evidenced by the lowest target value of **2.312**. As we move forward, our focus will remain on refining hypotheses around this central region, particularly testing combinations that consist of slight positive values alongside very low negative values to uncover additional high-output configurations. The following updated hypotheses will guide our next evaluations, targeting effective configurations while ensuring diversity in our sample selections.

Upon reflecting on the previous iterations and the latest dataset, it is evident that configurations near the origin continue to provide optimal target values, with the maximum recorded being **21.945**. The consistent pattern shows that combinations of slight positive values with very low negative influences significantly contribute to achieving target values in the range of **14 to 15.6**, with notable peaks at **15.578** and **15.036**. This indicates that a focused exploration of the parameter space around zero, particularly leveraging small positive values (generally between **1 and 2**) and minimal negative values (between **-0.5 and -0.1**), is essential for maximizing performance. Given these insights, we will continue refining our hypotheses, emphasizing new configurations that meet these criteria to identify additional high-output configurations while avoiding redundancy in our testing approaches. We aim for diversity in our ongoing exploration to uncover more potential optimal settings.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the optimization process, the evolution of hypotheses reflected a growing understanding of the parameter interactions and their impacts on the target output. Initially, the hypotheses aimed to explore diverse areas within the parameter space, including extreme values and central positions. However, as more experimental data was collected, it became evident that configurations near the origin, particularly those involving slight positive values alongside very low negative influences, yielded the highest target values.

The initial hypotheses demonstrated a broader exploration strategy, testing various combinations without fully leveraging the information gained from previous iterations. The successes around the origin, particularly the peak target of 21.945 when all parameters were set to zero, led to a focused approach in the latter hypotheses. Each subsequent iteration refined the strategies based on previous outcomes, emphasizing small variations around zero where peak performances were consistently observed.

Hypotheses were continuously adapted to cover specific configurations offering low negative impacts while exploring moderate positive values. This iterative learning process ultimately led to a set of hypotheses with high confidence, tailored around optimizing outputs based on previously observed successful configurations.
