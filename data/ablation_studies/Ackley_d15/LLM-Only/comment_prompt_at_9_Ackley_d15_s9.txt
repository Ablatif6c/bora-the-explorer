Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 9.
4 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.
You generated the following comments in the previous iterations and your suggestion points were subsequently evaluated and appended to the dataset:
## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "As we analyze the data from the first five iterations closely, we observe that the highest target value of 6.287 was obtained from the second hypothesis, which utilized a mid-range sampling strategy. This highlights that moderate values across the parameters seem to be effective in maximizing the target. The remaining configurations, especially those leaning heavily towards extremes, yielded significantly lower target values, notably 1.995 from iteration 1 and 2.076 from iteration 5. These results suggest that configurations utilizing extreme parameter settings, particularly those entailing large discrepancies between maximum and minimum values, are generally detrimental to performance. Additionally, the balanced positive configuration from iteration 4, which scored 4.287, indicates potential for further exploration in the region of mixed moderate and positive values. Moving forward, the focus will be on refining hypotheses that resonate with learned behavior from successful iterations, particularly those that hover around moderate to high positive values while integrating slight variations to capture potential synergies. We will discard overly extreme hypotheses while maintaining a strategy that prioritizes balanced configurations with a focus on mid-range parameters.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
