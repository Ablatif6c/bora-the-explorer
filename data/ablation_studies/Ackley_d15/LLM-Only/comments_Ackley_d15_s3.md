## Experiment Overview

The objective of this experiment is to optimize a mathematical black-box function through systematic exploration of defined parameter settings to maximize its target output. The function's behavior is unknown, making it imperative to adaptively probe the parameter space for optimal values. 

The experimental design encompasses 15 input variables, denoted as x_0 through x_14, each constrained within the bounds of -30 to 20. This uniform range allows us to methodically examine the effect of each parameter across a diverse spectrum. The optimization will rely on iteratively sampling points in this multidimensional space, evaluating the function's output, and using this feedback to refine our search for optimal parameters.

The anticipated outcome of the experiment is to identify the settings of the input variables that yield the highest performance of the black-box function. By carefully analyzing the results as data accumulates, we aim to develop insights into the function's underlying characteristics, ultimately maximizing the target objective. Successful completion of this experiment may also contribute to the formulation of effective strategies for similar optimization challenges in the future.

## Initial Thoughts

In our initial sampling step, we have crafted a set of five diverse hypotheses aimed at exploring a wide range of parameter combinations within the defined bounds. These hypotheses target different regions of the parameter space, balancing between extreme values and more central potential areas. We included hypotheses that sample the central region, positive extremities, and a mixture of low and high values, allowing us to assess the function's behavior effectively. This multifaceted approach is designed to uncover potential interactions among parameters and variations in the output that could lead to maximizing the target objective. As we gather data on these points, we will analyze the results to identify promising regions that can guide future explorations, ultimately aiming to develop a robust understanding of the black-box function's landscape.

## Iteration 6

As we evaluate our optimization progress after five iterations, several meaningful insights emerge from our experimental dataset. The highest target value recorded was 21.945 from iteration 1, corresponding to the hypothesis centered at the origin (0,0,...). This indicates that central regions within the parameter space, especially around the origin, are promising for achieving higher outputs. Meanwhile, the second hypothesis focused on upper extremes resulted in a significantly lower score of 4.652, suggesting that extreme positive values may detrimentally affect our target. Similarly, the negative exploration in iteration 5 yielded a target of 3.142, reinforcing that both positive and negative extremes do not enhance performance. The uniform positive sampling returned a modest 9.303, indicating that uniform approaches may need further refinement as well. In summary, we recognize that the central areas likely maximize the target output, while we should avoid extreme configurations that minimize it. Moving forward, it will be essential to refine our hypotheses based on these insights, emphasizing exploration around the origin and incorporating slight variations around this central point. Discarding poorly performing hypotheses, we will focus on new ones that utilize successful central patterns while accommodating possible variations to further navigate this landscape.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Refined Central Exploration

*Rationale:* Expanding slightly around the previous successful central sample to explore similar values for potential peaks.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 1, 'x_1': 1, 'x_2': 1, 'x_3': 1, 'x_4': 1, 'x_5': 1, 'x_6': 1, 'x_7': 1, 'x_8': 1, 'x_9': 1, 'x_10': 1, 'x_11': 1, 'x_12': 1, 'x_13': 1, 'x_14': 1}

#### Central Exploration with Variation

*Rationale:* Exploring slight variations around the successful central sampling to capture potential local maxima.

*Confidence:* high

*Points:*

- {'x_0': 2, 'x_1': -1, 'x_2': 1, 'x_3': 2, 'x_4': -1, 'x_5': 2, 'x_6': 1, 'x_7': 0, 'x_8': -1, 'x_9': 0, 'x_10': 1, 'x_11': 2, 'x_12': 1, 'x_13': 0, 'x_14': 1}

## Iteration 9

Upon reviewing the optimization progress through iteration 8, the highest target value recorded is 21.945 from iteration 1. This indicates that central values around the origin yield the best results, reinforcing the idea that we should focus our exploration in this region. Subsequent iterations (6 and 7) also produced substantial values of 18.320 and 17.475, respectively, which further confirms the potential of the central area. In contrast, configurations that approached the extremes, as evidenced in iterations 2 and 5, resulted in lower outputs of 4.652 and 3.142, suggesting that extreme values, both positive and negative, detract from the target. The mixed exploration in iteration 8 yielded a reasonable output of 12.086 but did not surpass previous successful outputs. Given this information, we should concentrate our hypotheses on slight variations and configurations around the successful central values. Our focus must shift away from any hypotheses that tested uniform or extreme configurations, as they consistently performed poorly. Instead, we will enhance our current hypotheses to explore promising variations in the central subspace, which we believe holds the key to maximizing our target objective effectively.

### Updated Hypotheses

#### Slightly Negative Central Variation

*Rationale:* Experimenting with slight negative variations while maintaining some central values that previously yielded a positive outcome.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

## Iteration 12

As we analyze the optimization progress through iteration 11, the data reveals crucial insights regarding the effectiveness of various parameter configurations. The highest recorded target value remains 21.945, which was achieved during iteration 1, indicating a strong performance associated with configurations near the origin (0,0,...). Results from subsequent hypotheses around this central region, such as outputs of 18.320 and 17.475, demonstrate the potential of exploring slight variations in this area. Meanwhile, extreme configurations, as evidenced in iterations 2 and 5, consistently returned lower outputs, with scores like 4.652 and 3.142, underscoring that diverging too far from the center is detrimental to performance.The most promising subspaces are evidently around the central area, with configurations skewed towards the origin yielding significantly higher target outputs. Conversely, experimental points that approach extremes or exhibit uniformity typically performed poorly. Given this data, it is crucial to refine our hypotheses, focusing on slight adjustments near the successful central configurations while discarding poorly performing extremes. The next steps will emphasize exploring narrowly between moderately high-performing configurations to unearth potential local maxima. This well-informed strategy should enhance our ability to maximize the target output efficiently.

#### Slightly Adjusted Negative Central Value

*Rationale:* Experimenting with slight negative variations while maintaining proximity to successful central values that previously produced positive results.

*Confidence:* medium

*Points:*

## Iteration 15

As we conclude iteration 14, careful analysis of the dataset reveals that the highest target value recorded is indeed 21.945, achieved with the configuration set at the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) during iteration 1. This result highlights the efficacy of central parameter settings in maximizing output, and subsequent iterations consistently yielded lower results when exploring extreme configurations, both positive (4.652 from iteration 2) and negative (3.142 from iteration 5). The more recent evaluations have also shown that configurations around the central region, particularly variations surrounding the origin, produced considerable output values ranging from 14.411 to 18.320, confirming that the central area holds the greatest promise for optimization. Notably, while mixed exploration strategies yielded some positive values, they did not surpass the highest outputs achievable from configurations near the center. Moving forward, our strategy should continue to prioritize exploration within the central subspace, avoiding extreme values that diminish the target output. We will optimize our hypotheses by fine-tuning our parameter settings around the most successful configurations, introducing slight variations to uncover potential local maxima. Discarding lower-performing hypotheses that tested extreme values, our focus will now pivot explicitly toward enhancing variations around effective central configurations to maximize the target objective efficiently.

## Iteration 18

As we analyze the optimization progress through iterative evaluations, it is clear that configurations close to the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) have consistently yielded the highest target outputs. The peak recorded target value remains at 21.945 from iteration 1, emphasizing the strong performance associated with the core central region. The dataset indicates that subsequent configurations around this region generated outputs ranging from approximately 14.411 to 18.320, reinforcing the notion that any deviations from the central area diminish the target score. Conversely, extreme configurations have been shown to produce significantly lower outputs, with scores as low as 3.142 and 4.652 from configurations tested in earlier iterations. Given these insights, our ongoing strategy will focus on refining hypotheses that explore slight variations around previously successful central configurations, avoiding any parameters leading towards historically lower outputs associated with extremes. We will continue to explore this promising subspace around the origin, integrating nuanced adjustments to uncover potential local maxima. This approach aims to maximize our target output as we progress through further iterations.

## Iteration 21

Reflecting on the optimization progress through iteration 20, the data reveals that configurations close to the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) have consistently yielded the highest target outputs. The maximum recorded value is 21.945, achieved during iteration 1. This peak performance emphasizes the efficacy of settings near the center of the parameter space. Subsequent iterations around this central area produced outputs ranging from approximately 14.411 to 18.320, reinforcing our understanding that even minor deviations from these central values still allow for strong performance potential. In contrast, configurations approaching the extremes yielded significantly lower outputs, with scores as low as 3.142 and 4.652 evident from previous iterations.     Given these insights, our strategy will focus on refining our hypotheses that explore slight variations around previous effective configurations while discarding poorer performing parameters that have demonstrated consistent underperformance. We will prioritize exploration within the central region, which we believe holds the highest potential for maximizing the target objective. The following enhanced hypotheses aim to capitalize on the central area, tuning parameter settings to potentially uncover local maxima and optimize the target output efficiently.

## Iteration 24

As we analyze the optimization progress after iteration 23, our focus remains on configurations around the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) which previously yielded the highest target outputs. Continuing from our previous insights, we aim to refine our hypothesis to explore slight variations in this central region, leveraging results that demonstrated promising performances. Configurations near the center have consistently shown potential to maximize the target, yielding values up to 21.945, with other successful approximations ranging from 14.411 to 18.320. Contrarily, points approaching extreme configurations have repeatedly resulted in lower outputs, solidifying our strategy to concentrate on central evaluations. The forthcoming hypotheses are structured to probe nuanced variations around successful configurations, while enhancing the exploration to uncover potential local maxima effectively.

## Iteration 27

Reflecting on the optimization progress through the extensive dataset gathered across iterations 1 to 26, it's clear that configurations near the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) have consistently produced the highest target outputs. The peak recorded value remains at 21.945, achieved during iteration 1, demonstrating the efficacy of settings in the central parameter region. Subsequent explorations near this configuration yielded promising scores ranging from 14.411 to 18.320. This reinforces the conclusion that slight variations around the origin can effectively maximize the target. In contrast, configurations veering towards extreme values, specifically those tested in iterations 2 and 5, resulted in significantly lower outputs of 4.652 and 3.142, indicating that extreme settings are detrimental to overall performance. The recent evaluations have consistently yielded outputs above 17 and often closer to 18 when adjustments are focused around the central values, validating our cautious strategy around this parameter region. Based on these insights, our revised approach will prioritize more refined exploration in this promising central subspace, fine-tuning hypotheses to capture local maxima while discarding poorly performing configurations. The focus will be on effectively leveraging these insights to maximize the target output efficiently.

Upon reviewing the dataset accumulated over the iterations, we observe a consistent trend indicating that configurations centered around the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) yield the highest target outputs. The peak recorded value is indeed 21.945, achieved in iteration 1, emphasizing the efficacy of settings very close to the center of the parameter space. Subsequent exploration around this central region has generated outputs ranging from 17.018 up to 18.320, confirming the potential of slight variations around the central area to maximize the target objective. Conversely, parameter settings approaching extreme values—both in the positive and negative directions—have resulted in significantly lower outputs, with scores such as 3.142 and 4.652 indicating that severe deviations from the center are detrimental to overall performance. In light of these findings, our strategy moving forward will concentrate on refining hypotheses that explore slight variations within the successful central configurations while systematically avoiding areas that have produced poor results. The upcoming hypotheses will aim to leverage the insights gained thus far to uncover local maxima effectively, maximizing our target output while remaining in the promising subspace around the origin. A focus on minor adjustments and more nuanced variations within the central region will be essential to enhance the optimization process.

## Iteration 35

Upon thorough evaluation of the optimization progress through iteration 34, our dataset reveals that configurations centered around the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) have consistently produced the highest target output of 21.945, achieved in iteration 1. This outcome unequivocally demonstrates the effectiveness of settings within the central region of the parameter space. Subsequent configurations, particularly those exploring variations around this center, have yielded outputs ranging from approximately 17.018 to 18.320. These metrics reinforce the critical insight that even slight adjustments around successful configurations can effectively maximize the target objective. In contrast, configurations venturing towards extreme values—both in the positive and negative directions—consistently resulted in significantly lower outputs, with scores as low as 3.142 and 4.652 evident from earlier iterations. Based on these findings, our ongoing strategy will emphasize refining hypotheses that explore minor variations around previously effective configurations, thereby focusing our optimization efforts on the central subspace which holds the greatest potential for achieving high target outputs. We will discard any hypotheses associated with extreme values and propose an enhanced set of explorations that maintain proximity to the effective outputs while adjusting subtle positive or negative variations to identify potential local maxima.

Upon thorough evaluation of the optimization progress through 42 iterations, it is clear that configurations centered around the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) have consistently produced the highest target output, achieving a peak value of 21.945 during iteration 1. This indicates the efficacy of settings near the center of the parameter space for maximizing outputs.

After thoroughly evaluating the dataset from iterations 1 to 60, we ascertain that configurations centered around the origin (0, 0, ..., 0) have culminated in the highest target output of 21.945, achieved in iteration 1. Subsequent experiments around this configuration have generated outputs consistently between approximately 17.018 and 18.320, corroborating the efficacy of exploring minor variations in the central area for maximizing the target function. Conversely, configurations that ventured toward extreme values, whether positive or negative, have consistently resulted in significantly lower outputs, with scores as low as 3.142 and 4.652 indicating detrimental effects due to distancing from the center. Given these observations, our strategy must focus on refining hypotheses that explore slight positive and negative adjustments within the historically successful central subspace. Moving forward, we will discard hypotheses that have demonstrated poor performance and concentrate on discovering potential local maxima by incorporating subtle variations around previously validated configurations. This will ensure we maximize our target output efficiently as we proceed into the next iterations.

Meanwhile, explorations into extreme positive and negative configurations, such as those recorded in iterations 2 and 5 (scoring 4.652 and 3.142 respectively), reiterated the negative impact of distancing from the center. As we move forward, our strategy will decisively focus on refining hypotheses that explore minor variations around these successful central configurations.

## Final Conclusions

Throughout the iterative process of optimization, the evolution of hypotheses has honed in on the effective exploration of the central parameter region, especially around the origin (0, 0, ..., 0). Initially, our hypotheses sampled various combinations, including extreme and uniform values, which illustrated poor performance indicators, particularly from the large negative and positive extremes. The high-performing configurations centered around the origin consistently yielded the best outputs, reinforcing the strategic pivot towards focusing on slight variations in this promising region.

As more data was collected, the hypotheses began narrowing down to refined explorations that included minor adjustments near previously successful configurations. Notably, the iteration data indicated diminishing returns when moving towards extremes and highlighted the efficacy of focusing adjustments within the central area. The confidence in hypotheses increased as they adapted to leverage these insights, favoring configurations that retained proximity to established optimal points. This adaptive methodology facilitated the discovery of potential local maxima among configurations that historically generated higher outputs.

Below is a summary table illustrating how confidence in our hypotheses evolved during the optimization iterations:

| Iteration | Hypothesis Name                       | Confidence Level |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|------------------|
| 1         | Central Region Exploration            | Medium           |
