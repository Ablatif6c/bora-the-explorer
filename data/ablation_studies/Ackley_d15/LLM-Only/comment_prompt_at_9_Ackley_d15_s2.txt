Your optimization is in progress and is currently at iteration 9.
4 new experimental data has been obtained from evaluating the points in your last hypotheses.
You generated the following comments in the previous iterations and your suggestion points were subsequently evaluated and appended to the dataset:
## Iteration 6:
{
    "comment": "As we progress to iteration 5, the gathered data provides valuable insights into the optimization process. The highest target value observed thus far was from the first hypothesis (iteration 1), which yielded 9.303, indicating that configurations near the center of the parameter space may be promising for maximizing the target outcome. In contrast, the extreme configurations (iteration 2 yielding 1.995 and iteration 3 yielding 2.312) were significantly lower, supporting the notion that these boundary regions may be detrimental for achieving optimal performance. The mixed extremes (iteration 4) resulted in 2.060, while the balanced mixed values (iteration 5) produced a modest 5.755, suggesting that random combinations may not be effective. This reinforces the idea that subspaces around the center of the parameter space (particularly close to zero) exhibit higher outputs, while configurations with extreme values tend to minimize the target. Moving forward, we will refine our exploration to focus on varied configurations centered around the promising points, eliminating the hypotheses that have consistently underperformed. Our future hypotheses will strategically probe these optimal areas with slight adjustments to further enhance our understanding of the parameter interactions.",

**Task:**
- Reflect on your previous hypotheses and on the entire data.
- What do we know from the data?
- Continue live commenting on the optimization progress.
- What are the subspaces that maximize target the most?
- What are the subspaces that are detrimental and minimize target?
- Improve your previous hypotheses for maximizing target in the light of the new comment and learnings. Feel free to also discard some hypotheses that have proven to be performing consistently poorly in previous iterations, and/or propose new ones. Additionally for each hypothesis, give a single point you want evaluate next.
