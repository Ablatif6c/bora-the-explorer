  "description": "The experiment is about maximizing the rate of hydrogen production from a photocatalyst mixture of different chemicals in water. The mixture is exposed to ultraviolet and visible light to generate hydrogen, and the amount produced is measured using gas chromatography. The goal is to enhance the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) through modifying the quantity of the chemicals such as adjustments to pH, ionic strength, addition of dyes and surfactants and so on, in the mixture.",
