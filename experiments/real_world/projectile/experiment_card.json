  "description": "We simulate a person located at (x=0, y=0) throwing a ball projectile toward a target located at (50, 0). We measure where the projectile lands and how close it comes to the target which is the distance error. Based on this distance error we map the result to a score (0-100), where higher scores mean a closer landing to the target. The goal is to maximize the score by adjusting the parameters and eventually hit the target.",
